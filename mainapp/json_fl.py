        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being.

        "Hey Sarthak bhai, the Olympian female who happens to have higher testosterone level, doesn't exactly have XY chromosome problem. IBA said she was disqualified for unknown test which is suspicious. The president of IBA was Russian and guess when this happened, right after Imane defeated Russian undefeated boxer. Speculation aside, they should specify the grounds for disqualification. I really don't like how everyone jumped on her at this problem.",

        "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

But today it was not of the quality that you and your team are known for. There was a tasteless joke about husband killing his wife over mobile hotspot. Unnecessary jokes about PM 2.5 and 56 inch chest comment of our PM, and students wanting to hit teachers. The show seemed to be wanting to become a meme generator. .Also, your newsletters programme was a very good initiative, but free ka recharge feels like a cheap publicity stunt to garner engagement. I hope you find better ways to generate revenue. I apologise if I'm being too harsh but the Sunday Show is a truly a breath of fresh air in the climate of toxic news and its sad to see it lose its USP. .Best of luck",

        "I want to tell you something brother just listen and tell me is it correct or not.....#investmentplan.#reservationlaw.#parisolympics..I am 18+ studying College pursuing engineering in tier 3 college....There is a normal surprise checking in the hostel. eveytime.One day all faculty came to check unnecessary things in hostels like iron , kettle ,or any electrical things.. Desktop or monitor..while checking this they found condoms in my luggage bag I never used it. But I kept it after watching a video on YouTube about safe sex. I thought if something happens in my life I will have it safely...But on that checking day they found condoms in my luggage and without any argument they suspended me .. I told them it is not an illegal weapon. Just listen . They didn't listen to anything and on that day itself they suspended me.. for 1 month .. I told them to give me guidance if I am wrong instead of punishment. But they didn't listen. .Please tell me something about it brother please only u can tell me please please please   all the faculties whom I was connected with they seeing me like I have done something wrong. They think I have the wrong eye for them.. but I know I will never be able  to prove myself to them .. those teachers  were very friendly with me.. they were supporting me in everything because I was good in studies but after this news they are behaving like strangers.. their words are like I didn't expect this from you.. it hurts .. is keeping condoms in my personal luggage bag is soo much big issue?? Please don't take out my name bro.  Otherwise the whole internet will take it in another direction  please guide me I see you as my brother figure I am the only child of my family..

        "I am 3 times national level medalist ( 1 gold in SGFI National level ) in silambam ( Indian martial arts) after covid whole silambam association in dead no more nationals are happening and it is very ancient sports of india and believe me it is not easy to play just watch videos on it on yt. After winning national level gold my scholarship amt of 21k came to me after 1.5 years of waiting. And forgot abt state level championships all of the players have to sleep on the floor 50 guys in a room and the food we got lets just not go there, we have to drink tap water for straight 5 day. Every athlete in this country has to go through infinite struggle there are soo many problems regarding sports in this country if i started talking abt that it will take hours, as of now i have stopped playing after covid as i also have to support financially, and now all the sports i play is cricket, football and badminton in turf….esa lgra hai kitna boldu but it’s never going to get over, so next time you see any sports players ( if they have represented your state or nation in any sports) try to respect them they have to go through a lot to reach there.. also i am straight 7 times state level gold medalist for the straight 7 years but got to play only 3 nationals and thats a whole different story,…….. peace",

        "#InvestmentPlan ..One thing I've learned in the last three years of working is that our approach to investments often isn't the best. You can't build wealth with a ₹500 SIP. Instead, invest that ₹500 in yourself through courses or books that suit you. Once you start making good money, you'll be able to invest more significantly and see better returns. Nobody got rich with a ₹500 SIP...People are willing to spend 10-20 lakhs on formal education but hesitate to invest ₹5000 in a course that can bring opportunities worth lakhs. How ironic! Investing in yourself is the best way forward, especially early in your career...Coming to the 100 ruppes, vaise toh Sarthak bhaiya free mey recharge de rahe hai but with that 100, I'll access the internet.

        "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male.

        "#ParisOlympics ..Sarthak bhaiya i totally aggre on the point that gender should be out of the sport.biological male should compete with biological male and biological female should compete with biological female.But here the case is wrong,she is born as female , the only problem that she have is that she has more male hormones than that estrogen. But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man. I have no hatered for any people and for not for LGBTQ community but I think such comments and remarks will only make the athlete mentally unstable for next matches...Sarthak bhaiya i just suggest you please mention this topic in next video..Other than this your video was very informative ..Thank you!!",

Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",
        "#SundayViichaar.Indian Education system is on ventilator now and students are in heaven........ No one is taking Everyone busy in Hindu Muslim, casteism etc.... .@sarthak What is your opinion on current education system???",
        "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree."

        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

        "#KanwarYatra\r.Our family's running tradition is to go on Kanwar Yatra after clearing Boards. It has been two years since I passed out from school and it still remains a dream. I really wanted to go but I might reconsider it after the news of Kanwar Yatri's outrage and violence. It is quite disheartening to see such a beautiful tradition in a bad light. As a Hindu, it becomes my responsibility to recover the damage. Ek jagah Hindus and Muslims are going on Kanwar Yatra unified and on the other hand, we get news of violence and vandalisation from these yatris who are symbols of devotion and Hinduism.",
        "22:04 #KanwarYatra its seems to be a big problem.. many reasons like   Huge involvement of unsocial elements , destroying someone’s property which he earned throughout his/her life span and to glorify it our ruling party made a rule of displaying name of vendors !! Personally the worst decision from bjp this time they made me feel regretted to vote ..If these things continue the real devotees will suffer and it might led to the closure of this Yatra if we look to a broader side",
        "I am 3 times national level medalist ( 1 gold in SGFI National level ) in silambam ( Indian martial arts) after covid whole silambam association in dead no more nationals are happening and it is very ancient sports of india and believe me it is not easy to play just watch videos on it on yt. After winning national level gold my scholarship amt of 21k came to me after 1.5 years of waiting. And forgot abt state level championships all of the players have to sleep on the floor 50 guys in a room and the food we got lets just not go there, we have to drink tap water for straight 5 day. Every athlete in this country has to go through infinite struggle there are soo many problems regarding sports in this country if i started talking abt that it will take hours, as of now i have stopped playing after covid as i also have to support financially, and now all the sports i play is cricket, football and badminton in turf….esa lgra hai kitna boldu but it’s never going to get over, so next time you see any sports players ( if they have represented your state or nation in any sports) try to respect them they have to go through a lot to reach there.. also i am straight 7 times state level gold medalist for the straight 7 years but got to play only 3 nationals and thats a whole different story,…….. peace",

        "#SundayVichar Namskar Aadam and Welcome to the 5 months recharge plan.1. Olympics controversy:- I think male and females should have their area to play. Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",
        "19:00  Hailing from one of the developing cities of East I had the opportunity in Lockdown to explore investment, I was financially stable by my part time teaching & my college fees were covered under scholarship, unlike my friends & peers where i witnessed lack of interest towards investment & future financial planning I thought it might be under the influence of society that we lived in but now that I have explored half of Northern States & connected with people's of diverse backgrounds I realise how important is to integrate financial literacy in curriculum. ..#InvestmentPlan start toh karo investment; people are scared to the core to even think of investment apart from Buying assets, currently in Capital City but there is little to no curiosity in exploring investment tools maybe due to hectic corporate life or something else that I have still to experience...#Backbenchers well i was neither a proper backbenchers nor the topper somewhere in between I did to some extent everything of both came top in few subjects scored lowest in some but it was a journey today when i visit schools of Delhi for surveys I wonder where we went wrong in the process of adopting Digital Inclusivity we lost the very essence of friends, senior junior interaction or be it school teachers being in touch outside school & curriculum.

        "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out. And Love Your Content Sarthak Ji",

        "#SundayVichar Sarthak bhai I have been following your content for more than a year now and was a big fan of your videos and your way of presentation. But for a quite long, your videos became too political that the fun element of the videos was just lost. Maybe this was due to the fact that the atmosphere of our nation has become such that we can't talk for a minute without presenting our political ideologies. But after watching this video, I have felt that the old style and aura of your videos have returned, that is too fun to watch along with unbiased information. This video has subtly mentioned a lot of issues and news that are relevant for us and was to the point. Glad to have the same The Sunday Show back!!..And talking about the various issues, I feel like almost all of them must be discussed today, but after being informative, unbiased and rational, for which I am learning more about those issues in detail. Nothing much to say, just felt like expressing this to you & your team.",

Ha abhi bhi India ke gao me jat -pat me mante he pr sehro me to bo bilkul khatam ho chuka he unke sath to koi discrimination nhi hota to bha se to khatam ho sakti he.. Mere kuch point he is pr - .  .1. Pehla to yehi ki rsevation unhe deni chahiye jinhe jarurat. Mere bahute se yese dost he jinke mami papa sarakari nokri me he or bo sc st catagory ke hone ke karan har chiz me easily select ho jate he. Instead mere papa yek farmer he or me general catagory  ka hu mere pass utne resources  nhi he fir bhi mujhe unke comparision me bhute jada mehnat karni padhti he.  Kisi bhi  exam ka cutoff sc st ke liye general se adha hota he. ..2. Me abhi collage me bsc kr rha hu. Mere  yek sal ki fees 10,000 he. Or  jo sc st bale unki 4000.. Jabki me to 10,000 bhi afford nhi kar sakta bhute muskil se aford kr pa rha hu . .Jinki 4000 he bo easly afford kr sakte he . 10000 se jada to bo mahine ka yese hi udha dete he  but fir bhi reservation  lete he ...3. Or sath me mujhe koi exam form bharne ho  .To meri fees lagti he or unki koi fees nhi lagti ..Yek exam form ki fees meri lagbhag 1000-1500  lagti he or unhe bahi exam free. Me de sakte he..4. Or me abhi ssc gd ki tayri kr rha tha fir form bharne ke time mujhe pata chla ki general ke bacho ke liye  hieght  170 cm honi chahiye  bahi   sc st balo ke liye 152 ya 154 cm chal padhegi . My hieght is 163 cm . Me us din bahute roya.  . . Koi govt. Se support nhi milta jitne resorces he  usme apna 100% deta hu fir bhi selection nhi hota kisi chiz me to dukh hota he or apne hi dost jiske mujhse adhe se bhi kam number aye he  jo yek achi finacial condition se ata he or uska selction ho jata he to kahi na kahi bura to lagta he bhute jada. . Me himachal se yek gao se hu or mujhe pata he ki sc st balo ko reservation  ki jarurat he lakin sabhi ko nhi  hamara gao me top govt. Job bale log sc st bale hi he or kuch sc st bale jinko genualy jarurat he bo iska fayda he ni uthate. Or ham jese general catagury ke boys jinko genualy jarurat he kosis bhi karate he unke liye sarkar kuch nhi  karti .  ..At last srthak bhi lots of love and respect to you ..PLESE MAKE A FULL VIDEO ON THIS INTERVIEWING PEOPLE . .LOVE YOU",

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

Michael Phelps has a bigger wingspan than the average male and Michael Jordan is taller than an avg person so they shouldn't be playing because they have an unfair advantage. That doesn't make sense. They were banned last time because of a single man and his corrupt ideology and he has been removed from the committee. Same thing happened to our Dutee Chand.

        "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree."

        "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

If this thing happened this cuttoff will even go down. we should point out one thing even  there are people from sc/st who have become exceptionally rich(wealth). Still in IIT/IISc/IIMs/NLU are very few faculty less then 15% (reserved by law for sc) and 5%(reserved by law for sc). 0 generation student from sc/st they only study for survival. Therefore they target jobs like group c or group D. But 1st generation target jobs from group c or group a or group b. As jobs in group A(particularly iit faculty seats. Dept.

My question is if they are unable to find out talent withoutcreamy layer how can they find out with creamy layer) are not filled As per the law",
        "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

        "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

        "Hi Sarthak,..First and foremost, thank you for the amazing work you and your team do. Your content is so engaging that I wish it were a daily dive into the news instead of just weekly. Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards."

        "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",
        "I strongly oppose the Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2024. This bill is a blatant attempt to stifle freedom of expression and creativity in India. By requiring content creators to obtain licenses and follow strict rules, the government is essentially trying to control what we say and think. This is a clear attack on democracy and our fundamental rights.\r.\r.The fact that even international creators like Taylor Swift and Mr. Beast will be subject to content evaluation committees is absurd. It's a clear example of how this bill will not only harm Indian content creators but also make our country a laughing stock globally.\r.\r.We must stand against this bill and fight for our right to freely express ourselves. We cannot let the government turn us into puppets and dictate what we can and cannot say. The future of our democracy and creative freedom depends on it.",

        "#ReservationLaw\r.\r.Hello Sarthak Bhaiya,\r.\r.I am 17 years old, living in a very small city (less than tier-2 cities), studying in class 12, and preparing for JEE Advanced 2025 to get admission into IITs and NITs. I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

            "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

I am from Maharashtra and there's a reason why Sairat was made in Marathi. I feel ashamed to see that people not just General but even OBC, SC and minorities are so obsessed about their castes that they even willing to go to the extent of murdering their own daughters and son in law. However I think Supreme Court's decision is very right and should be welcomed by all states as I have friends from all the communities and I know they are not on the same level so sub classification will definitely be good step in uplifting the poor but we have seen that due to Pooja Khedkar scam many more people who misused EWS and OBC NCL so there should be strict and transparent system for the sub classification. .Although I am from general category, I support reservation as I have seen the discrimination myself and no particular community is responsible for it but it's a collective failure that we are still stuck in castes when world is talking about equality for all masses, genders and sexualities. I pledge that I will never discriminate or be quiet after seeing discrimination of my fellow brothers and sisters on the basis of caste, creed, religion, language, region, gender or race.

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you.

Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

We have 2 boxers who are born as a woman, who have been raised a woman, who has passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women. And this is a very clear definition of a woman. There was never any doubt about them being a woman. What we see now is that some want to own the definition of who is a woman.... .All those who tweeted on this are not journalists nor fact checkers.

This isnt an issue of a biological man in womens sports (which i'm against) this is a issue of corruption and racism. Imane was born and raised a woman and has never 'identified' otherwise. Also Algeria is a conservative muslim nation where one couldnt transition even if they wanted to. The Italian boxer has a history of calling out of the match when she is losing.

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

She cannot be a Male at this point, cannot be a female, then what is it?..It is absolutely not like she has just identified herself as a Female or gone through a gender change surgery to get unfair advantage, absolutely not.

But today it was not of the quality that you and your team are known for. There was a tasteless joke about husband killing his wife over mobile hotspot. Unnecessary jokes about PM 2.5 and 56 inch chest comment of our PM, and students wanting to hit teachers. The show seemed to be wanting to become a meme generator. .Also, your newsletters programme was a very good initiative, but free ka recharge feels like a cheap publicity stunt to garner engagement. I hope you find better ways to generate revenue. I apologise if I'm being too harsh but the Sunday Show is a truly a breath of fresh air in the climate of toxic news and its sad to see it lose its USP. .Best of luck",

Mere bahute se yese dost he jinke mami papa sarakari nokri me he or bo sc st catagory ke hone ke karan har chiz me easily select ho jate he. Instead mere papa yek farmer he or me general catagory  ka hu mere pass utne resources  nhi he fir bhi mujhe unke comparision me bhute jada mehnat karni padhti he.  Kisi bhi  exam ka cutoff sc st ke liye general se adha hota he. ..2. Me abhi collage me bsc kr rha hu. Mere  yek sal ki fees 10,000 he. Or  jo sc st bale unki 4000.. Jabki me to 10,000 bhi afford nhi kar sakta bhute muskil se aford kr pa rha hu . .Jinki 4000 he bo easly afford kr sakte he . 10000 se jada to bo mahine ka yese hi udha dete he  but fir bhi reservation  lete he ...3. Or sath me mujhe koi exam form bharne ho  .To meri fees lagti he or unki koi fees nhi lagti ..Yek exam form ki fees meri lagbhag 1000-1500  lagti he or unhe bahi exam free. Me de sakte he..4. Or me abhi ssc gd ki tayri kr rha tha fir form bharne ke time mujhe pata chla ki general ke bacho ke liye  hieght  170 cm honi chahiye  bahi   sc st balo ke liye 152 ya 154 cm chal padhegi . My hieght is 163 cm . Me us din bahute roya.  . . Koi govt. Se support nhi milta jitne resorces he  usme apna 100% deta hu fir bhi selection nhi hota kisi chiz me to dukh hota he or apne hi dost jiske mujhse adhe se bhi kam number aye he  jo yek achi finacial condition se ata he or uska selction ho jata he to kahi na kahi bura to lagta he bhute jada. . Me himachal se yek gao se hu or mujhe pata he ki sc st balo ko reservation  ki jarurat he lakin sabhi ko nhi  hamara gao me top govt.

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

            "#ReservationLaw\r.\r.Hello Sarthak Bhaiya,\r.\r.I am 17 years old, living in a very small city (less than tier-2 cities), studying in class 12, and preparing for JEE Advanced 2025 to get admission into IITs and NITs. I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

            "#ParisOlympics .Ive been following the sunday show since sometime now and have found it very informative and entertaining. .I believe what you said about Imane Khelif needs further research before giving your opinion and moving on. Tagging her a as a man was not fair just because of a report which said she has xy chromosomes.  Lets make it more easy for everyone to follow, does she have male reproductive organs, no. Does she fit the checkmarks of a transgender? No. .The reports say she is a female with DSD. Now whats required is to understand what DSD is, educate your viewers what DSD is and then share your opinion and open thr comments for discussion. .Honestly, i am not an expert, and am equally curious to know more, but shutting the topic with you can change your pronouns but you cannot change your chromosomes is quite disappointing..#you'rebetterthanthis",

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

She cannot be a Male at this point, cannot be a female, then what is it?..It is absolutely not like she has just identified herself as a Female or gone through a gender change surgery to get unfair advantage, absolutely not. She was brought up as a woman, taught and trained as a woman. competed with women all her life, and when she finally wins, we discriminate her again, because apparently, she has XY chromosomes?..search about DSD sarthak, search about how chromosomes should not identify your sex. because we as 8 billion humans, are born differently, every step of the way...I hope you cover it and feature my comment in the next video. and Let's talk on this matter, it's a serious topic",

Later, she won the case and was cleared to race again. The point I want to make is that it is not as simple as male and female. There are rigorous committees that guide these big events. Furthermore, she is a biological female at the end of the day who has female reproductive organs and just outrightly saying that it is unfair because she is a man would be a disservice to the efforts that she has put in for the sport. #parisolympics",

            "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

Mere bahute se yese dost he jinke mami papa sarakari nokri me he or bo sc st catagory ke hone ke karan har chiz me easily select ho jate he.

Kisi bhi  exam ka cutoff sc st ke liye general se adha hota he. ..2. Me abhi collage me bsc kr rha hu. Mere  yek sal ki fees 10,000 he. Or  jo sc st bale unki 4000.. Jabki me to 10,000 bhi afford nhi kar sakta bhute muskil se aford kr pa rha hu . .Jinki 4000 he bo easly afford kr sakte he . 10000 se jada to bo mahine ka yese hi udha dete he  but fir bhi reservation  lete he ...3. Or sath me mujhe koi exam form bharne ho  .To meri fees lagti he or unki koi fees nhi lagti ..Yek exam form ki fees meri lagbhag 1000-1500  lagti he or unhe bahi exam free. Me de sakte he..4. Or me abhi ssc gd ki tayri kr rha tha fir form bharne ke time mujhe pata chla ki general ke bacho ke liye  hieght  170 cm honi chahiye  bahi   sc st balo ke liye 152 ya 154 cm chal padhegi . My hieght is 163 cm . Me us din bahute roya.  . . Koi govt. Se support nhi milta jitne resorces he  usme apna 100% deta hu fir bhi selection nhi hota kisi chiz me to dukh hota he or apne hi dost jiske mujhse adhe se bhi kam number aye he  jo yek achi finacial condition se ata he or uska selction ho jata he to kahi na kahi bura to lagta he bhute jada. . Me himachal se yek gao se hu or mujhe pata he ki sc st balo ko reservation  ki jarurat he lakin sabhi ko nhi  hamara gao me top govt.

The way you cover news with a blend of entertainment is simply amazing and making me look forward to every Sunday with great anticipation...Your unique approach to presenting news has rekindled my interest in current events, and I find myself eagerly waiting for each new episode. I love the creativity, humor, and insights you bring to your show. It has become a part of my weekly routine...I was so impressed that I started recommending your channel to my family and friends. Now, not only me, but five of my friends also eagerly await your Sunday show. Today, we all gathered at my place to watch your latest video on TV. We even decided to binge-watch your last 10 Sunday shows, and it was an incredible experience...Your work is truly remarkable, and I want you to know that you have our full support. Keep doing what you're doing; it's making a significant positive impact...Thank you !.Much love and support !",
            "Sarthak, this is the second video where you've not done the due diligence of actually reaearching...1. The boxer is a female (biological) read the comment by @lakshyasharma3826 on your youtube video. That is good enough and i won't add more value to this comment...2. There was a video of biden that was cropped and shown as if he walks out of the frame when hes supposed to walk somewhere else. This was also incorrect. You should've researched and understood the narrative. You can't make content that is mid anymore. You're good and i hope this comment makes you want to do better justice to your future audience. https://youtu.be/383ggvjhciU..Please don't let us down. I believe you can do better.",
            "#ParisOlympics .Sarthak, with duely respecting everyone's opinions, I'd like to say something. A few weeks back, I came across this study where scientists and biologists explained the relation between sexes and chromosomes. .We clearly know there's a difference between gender and sex, gender being societal in nature..This study showed that there aren't just XX and XY combinations possible, but a lot more..There's just X, there are semi-developed ones too (I'm just saying what I had read, these aren't proved by me)..What the wrestler faced, was one of the cases mentioned. She is biologically female, but like you had mentioned, with XY dominated chromosomes..I meant, it's not her fault she has this; as a female, she's just playing in a female category...Categorizing sports on the basis of this doesn't seem fair, but I really wish there was a solution to this.",

First,  our country's athletes do not get respect even after winning Olympic and more international medals. You can remember our *Wrestlers' protest.* In my opinion, not getting justice for serious allegations like sexual abuse of wrestlers is a big discouragement for players, especially for female players..  And secondly, *Manipur,* one of India's most sporting states, which gifts Olympic winners like Mary Kom and Mirabai Chanu, has riots throughout the year. Manipur and other north-east States provide us so many good players but our government only remembers them during elections and completely forgots them rest of time.

This isnt an issue of a biological man in womens sports (which i'm against) this is a issue of corruption and racism. Imane was born and raised a woman and has never 'identified' otherwise. Also Algeria is a conservative muslim nation where one couldnt transition even if they wanted to. The Italian boxer has a history of calling out of the match when she is losing.

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

Nobody got rich with a ₹500 SIP...People are willing to spend 10-20 lakhs on formal education but hesitate to invest ₹5000 in a course that can bring opportunities worth lakhs. How ironic!

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

Due to such instances, I had to almost drop a full semester, couldn't complete my courses, attempted suicide. This topic is worth talking about where we acknowledge mental illness as well.

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",
            "Sarthak bhai I have seen many people in coaching centres u can clearly see the difference between a reserved candidate(privileged ones) and a general candidate many a times they sleep in classes operate iphones and they have taken reservations for granted there parents were from IITs/do good jobs and earn very much but still they get reservations I think in Creamy layer people will still use loopholes to avail it but I think it's a great start. Would love to know your opinion on how will it impact and another way to modernise reservations so that real needy can avail it??",

I support your effort to try and educate people and get them engaged in current affairs so please know that I mean no hate towards you. But this is the second time I am trying to address a lack of understanding in gender theory from you. In this case especially the terf ideology (JK Rowling’s brand of feminism) has now actually targeted a cis-woman not even a trans woman. While an actually convicted rapist is also being allowed to participate and no major news outlets and incels on the internet are actually speaking up on it. Shows how much they actually care about women’s safety as opposed to furthering their insecure agenda. I think you should gain a more professional opinion in this subject or atleast have your team do more research before you inform someone on subjects like this. You are responsible for a large audience many of whom are impressionable youngsters who are looking for a way to build their ideology. It is important for you to have as clean of a perspective as you can have on these topics",

It's disheartening that, even today, 95% of our villagers families still practice discrimination. This mindset needs to change; nothing bad will happen if people from different backgrounds interact. But the older generation, those in their 60s and older, don't understand because this has been passed down through generations. What's your take on this sarthak bhai. Btw I have following you since you had work for The deshbhakt. And I will be among few that I watch you from your 1st video in this sarthak goswami channel. Love you ",

Now between this two types of candidates when any competition will be taken it's obvious the first one will crack it having better growing opportunities and thus the lower class of sc st ( villages ) remains in the same position. In this way the richer sc st s gets all. ..Now the solution could be this :..During any form fillup the candidate has to submit the pan ID of their parents, from there the income of their parents can be fetched and if the limit crosses then the candidate can't avail the sc st facilities. Then he or she will be treated as a General. Thus a deserving sc st will get all the facilities ( zero form fillup and reservation)..Add on : Documents of electricity bill can also be used cause it shows your financial condition ( for those whose parents are not doing any government job )..Thank you ",

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",
            "#parisolympics.There is much misinformation and some facts people should not overlook them...1. Both of these women (including Lin Yu-ting) are neither trans athletes nor anything else that indicates they changed their gender. They were born biological women (as far as the facts are reported). People calling them men is not in good taste, at least until it is proven otherwise...2. The whole thing started with the IBA ban in the World Championship, for which we have no idea what tests were done on these women. The IBA says testosterone was not tested; they only said both had the Y chromosome (what test? no idea). Between one and two percent of the population has variations in sex biology. Some studies estimate that about 1 in 15,000 women have Y chromosomes in some or all of their cells. Some of those women with Y chromosomes have high testosterone, some don't. And again, we have no idea whether either of these particular women have high testosterone because that test has not been done. Many people are arguing that these women have high testosterone. We simply do not know whether that is true or not...3. If they are actually biological women and have a biological advantage, why should we punish them? Michael Phelps's physical advantages, such as his arm span and reduced lactic acid production, have not led to disqualification but rather celebrated his unique capabilities within the sport. That does not mean Michael Phelps has not done the hard work, and neither have these women.",

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being.

Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

Both of these women (including Lin Yu-ting) are neither trans athletes nor anything else that indicates they changed their gender. They were born biological women (as far as the facts are reported). People calling them men is not in good taste, at least until it is proven otherwise...2. The whole thing started with the IBA ban in the World Championship, for which we have no idea what tests were done on these women. The IBA says testosterone was not tested; they only said both had the Y chromosome (what test? no idea). Between one and two percent of the population has variations in sex biology. Some studies estimate that about 1 in 15,000 women have Y chromosomes in some or all of their cells. Some of those women with Y chromosomes have high testosterone, some don't. And again, we have no idea whether either of these particular women have high testosterone because that test has not been done. Many people are arguing that these women have high testosterone. We simply do not know whether that is true or not...3. If they are actually biological women and have a biological advantage, why should we punish them? Michael Phelps's physical advantages, such as his arm span and reduced lactic acid production, have not led to disqualification but rather celebrated his unique capabilities within the sport.

Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

Bohut log bolte hai intercaste marriage ke bare mein, apne vi bola (main vi chahta hun, next generation ke liye iske bohut fyde hain medial point of view se) likin humare ghar wale manenge nhi kyuki unko varosa nhi upper caste walo par. Past ka stigma upar se tribals mein community others ko accept toh karti nhi upar se jinhone intercaste marriage kar liya unko-unke family members ko functions mein bulate nhi, outcast ghosit kar diya jata hai. Aisa bohut hua hai ki bhag ke shadi ki fir ya toh upper caste walo ne bura bartav Kiya fir wo ladka/ladki ne apni jaan leli ya fir bohut bura kiya uske sath ya fir tribal community se outcast kar diya. Jitna vi ho jai kisi ko outcast kar diya jata hai usko bohut fark padhta hai tumhare bure ya achche waqt mein koi apna nhi, even tumhare baccho ki shadi tak affect hoga....Mere West Bengal main kuch hi aise jagah hai jaha dusre caste se Milne julne pe pabandi lagi hui hai. Mere yaha har dharm ke saath mil jul ke rehte hai hum, unke culture mein ghul chuke hain but jab unki bari aati wo humare culture ka ya toh mazaak udate hai nhi toh apne hisab se rule banake humne sikhane aajate hai. Agar ek caste ke log dusre ke dharm ka respect karenge, niyam janke unka palan karenge & also politicians ya fir kuch so called hindu ya sanatani, dusre dharm ke log  dharm< not everyone >  ke naam pe ladai , vedvav na karenge toh caste system uth sakta hai. Koi caste ka reservation na karke economically reservation hone pe & opportunities pane pe uchi jaat nichi jaat aisa vedvav na karke agar har kisi ko uske achievement ke dam par kaam-recognition mile toh kuch ho sakta hai....Humara vi alag ek dharm hai SARI DHARM, likin hum vi shivji ki puja karte hai bus yehi alag hai ki humara dharm , rules, community sab kuch jungle se juda hua hai. Hum ped paudh-mitti-janwar mein bhagwan ki puja karte hai, humare rituals mandir se bohut  alag hote hai....**Yaha maine caste system ke problem par baat ki hai KISI KE DHARM YA UNKE RITI RIWAJ KO DISRESPECT KARNE KA MERA KOI INTENTION NHI HAI. Har kisi ko apna dharm pyara hai, dharm ka palan karna chahiye. Likin dharm ke naam pe vedvav ya dusre ke upar apna dharm zabardasti lagu karna nhi chahiye.",

You can remember our *Wrestlers' protest.* In my opinion, not getting justice for serious allegations like sexual abuse of wrestlers is a big discouragement for players, especially for female players..  And secondly, *Manipur,* one of India's most sporting states, which gifts Olympic winners like Mary Kom and Mirabai Chanu, has riots throughout the year. Manipur and other north-east States provide us so many good players but our government only remembers them during elections and completely forgots them rest of time.

This isnt an issue of a biological man in womens sports (which i'm against) this is a issue of corruption and racism. Imane was born and raised a woman and has never 'identified' otherwise.

For example, our neighbors often call their kids by their surnames, which seems like a way to remind us of caste differences and make us feel inferior. This shows that just because someone is financially stable doesn't mean they won't face social issues...We waited our whole lives to buy this house, spending years in rental places and saving up for this moment.

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

Her gender or testosterone levels were never questioned, and she has no particularly stellar record, although she has been improving recently. She was tested at the 2022 World Championships, found no issues, and took the silver medal without incident. At the 2023 World Championships, after defeating a Russian boxer in the Round of 16, she was suddenly declared ineligible based on tests from 2022 and 2023. The International Boxing Association (IBA), which oversees these championships, has a history of corruption, financial dependence on Russian-owned Gazprom, and a controversial Russian president elected in 2020. The IOC severed ties with the IBA due to these issues, and multiple countries boycotted the 2023 World Championships. The IBA claimed Khelif had XY chromosomes based on a 2022 test, yet allowed her to compete until she beat a Russian athlete. There was no evidence of elevated testosterone, and no prior eligibility issues. .She is 100% female who spent her whole life training to be the best female boxer, and just because her opponent felt pain and wasn’t strong enough to fight such a professional boxer she started to say that the Algerian boxer is a MAN and  most people went along with her?!!

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

            "#SundaySoch.Hey sarthak .I am from one of the top IITs and have suffered from a lack of acknowledgement of mental health issues. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety along with other disorders and had to go through many anxiety attacks in between ongoing semesters. One such incident was when I had an attack and couldn't give the mid semester examination, professors refused to accept the report where my condition was mentioned. .This discloses a very serious problem in our system where we do not acknowledge mental illness as an 'illness'. Due to such instances, I had to almost drop a full semester, couldn't complete my courses, attempted suicide. This topic is worth talking about where we acknowledge mental illness as well. The only problem arises is how to determine whether a person had an anxiety attack on a particular day or not, I cannot think of a practical solution in this, but maybe if we raise our voice, we can work on it together.",

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

It was our first day vo BBA wali mai BCOM wala hamare batch mai 499 londe the tho mai or mere dost bs yuhi BBA mai nikal gye and there i met her........ She was(is) stunning. As beautiful as the northern lights and as cute as a baby. Then i tried to talk to her i got her number and her insta and we started talking and in feb 2023 i told her for first time that i like you and would love to be in relationship with you. She said no . .Pr vo mard he kya jo haar maan jaye. .So I still tried to convense her and in November she finally told me. I would like to be in relationship with you. And for first time in my life I cried that day. Then we met on 7th December to watch movie as both of our birthday parties ( uska 5 or mera 6). For the first time i hold her hand. It was like heaven. Then we started meeting regularly or dekhte he dekhte mai uska pasandida mard bn gaya or vo tho pheli nazar sai he meri pasandida aurat thi. .But.My sister had 2 problems with her 1 big and another one small (and funny) .1. Im JAAT and and she's PRAJAPATI. And also she's from UP but living in jodhpur from the day she was born and I'm natively from Jodhour, RAJASTHAN. Meri behen nai bola ke hamara baap manega nhi iske liye. So she told me bapu ko manana hai tho ameer bn ja kyunki kisi sai bhi shadi kr sktha hai. So i decided to become rich. I'm trying to be an editor and want to start an infotech yt channel (aapka rival ). And even my pasandida aurat is ready to fight with me for our future. .2. Uski height choti hai . Im 6'1 and she's 5'3. Not a big problem but a funny one. ..I'm currently 19 and she's also 19 and I hope we get to marry each other. She's also my first girlfriend and I'm also her 1st boyfriend and I hope I'll be her last and she's also my last. ...I'm in support of intercaste marriages (not only because maine intercaste ladki ko padand kiya hai).

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

The IBA claimed Khelif had XY chromosomes based on a 2022 test, yet allowed her to compete until she beat a Russian athlete. There was no evidence of elevated testosterone, and no prior eligibility issues. .She is 100% female who spent her whole life training to be the best female boxer, and just because her opponent felt pain and wasn’t strong enough to fight such a professional boxer she started to say that the Algerian boxer is a MAN and  most people went along with her?!!

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

            "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons.

I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

            "#reservation.I have seen people talking against reservation all the time but are not willing to give equal rights and respect to everyone. I am from Maharashtra and there's a reason why Sairat was made in Marathi. I feel ashamed to see that people not just General but even OBC, SC and minorities are so obsessed about their castes that they even willing to go to the extent of murdering their own daughters and son in law. However I think Supreme Court's decision is very right and should be welcomed by all states as I have friends from all the communities and I know they are not on the same level so sub classification will definitely be good step in uplifting the poor but we have seen that due to Pooja Khedkar scam many more people who misused EWS and OBC NCL so there should be strict and transparent system for the sub classification. .Although I am from general category, I support reservation as I have seen the discrimination myself and no particular community is responsible for it but it's a collective failure that we are still stuck in castes when world is talking about equality for all masses, genders and sexualities. I pledge that I will never discriminate or be quiet after seeing discrimination of my fellow brothers and sisters on the basis of caste, creed, religion, language, region, gender or race.

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",
            "#parisolympics.There is much misinformation and some facts people should not overlook them...1. Both of these women (including Lin Yu-ting) are neither trans athletes nor anything else that indicates they changed their gender. They were born biological women (as far as the facts are reported). People calling them men is not in good taste, at least until it is proven otherwise...2. The whole thing started with the IBA ban in the World Championship, for which we have no idea what tests were done on these women. The IBA says testosterone was not tested; they only said both had the Y chromosome (what test? no idea). Between one and two percent of the population has variations in sex biology. Some studies estimate that about 1 in 15,000 women have Y chromosomes in some or all of their cells. Some of those women with Y chromosomes have high testosterone, some don't. And again, we have no idea whether either of these particular women have high testosterone because that test has not been done. Many people are arguing that these women have high testosterone. We simply do not know whether that is true or not...3. If they are actually biological women and have a biological advantage, why should we punish them? Michael Phelps's physical advantages, such as his arm span and reduced lactic acid production, have not led to disqualification but rather celebrated his unique capabilities within the sport. That does not mean Michael Phelps has not done the hard work, and neither have these women.",

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you.

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

I support your effort to try and educate people and get them engaged in current affairs so please know that I mean no hate towards you. But this is the second time I am trying to address a lack of understanding in gender theory from you. In this case especially the terf ideology (JK Rowling’s brand of feminism) has now actually targeted a cis-woman not even a trans woman. While an actually convicted rapist is also being allowed to participate and no major news outlets and incels on the internet are actually speaking up on it. Shows how much they actually care about women’s safety as opposed to furthering their insecure agenda. I think you should gain a more professional opinion in this subject or atleast have your team do more research before you inform someone on subjects like this. You are responsible for a large audience many of whom are impressionable youngsters who are looking for a way to build their ideology.

            "#SundayVichar Namskar Aadam and Welcome to the 5 months recharge plan.1. Olympics controversy:- I think male and females should have their area to play. Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

But today it was not of the quality that you and your team are known for. There was a tasteless joke about husband killing his wife over mobile hotspot. Unnecessary jokes about PM 2.5 and 56 inch chest comment of our PM, and students wanting to hit teachers. The show seemed to be wanting to become a meme generator. .Also, your newsletters programme was a very good initiative, but free ka recharge feels like a cheap publicity stunt to garner engagement. I hope you find better ways to generate revenue. I apologise if I'm being too harsh but the Sunday Show is a truly a breath of fresh air in the climate of toxic news and its sad to see it lose its USP. .Best of luck",

Instead, invest that ₹500 in yourself through courses or books that suit you. Once you start making good money, you'll be able to invest more significantly and see better returns. Nobody got rich with a ₹500 SIP...People are willing to spend 10-20 lakhs on formal education but hesitate to invest ₹5000 in a course that can bring opportunities worth lakhs. How ironic! Investing in yourself is the best way forward, especially early in your career...Coming to the 100 ruppes, vaise toh Sarthak bhaiya free mey recharge de rahe hai but with that 100, I'll access the internet.

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

I met my beautiful girl  in first year its was 12th October 2022. It was our first day vo BBA wali mai BCOM wala hamare batch mai 499 londe the tho mai or mere dost bs yuhi BBA mai nikal gye and there i met her........ She was(is) stunning. As beautiful as the northern lights and as cute as a baby. Then i tried to talk to her i got her number and her insta and we started talking and in feb 2023 i told her for first time that i like you and would love to be in relationship with you. She said no . .Pr vo mard he kya jo haar maan jaye. .So I still tried to convense her and in November she finally told me. I would like to be in relationship with you. And for first time in my life I cried that day. Then we met on 7th December to watch movie as both of our birthday parties ( uska 5 or mera 6). For the first time i hold her hand. It was like heaven. Then we started meeting regularly or dekhte he dekhte mai uska pasandida mard bn gaya or vo tho pheli nazar sai he meri pasandida aurat thi. .But.My sister had 2 problems with her 1 big and another one small (and funny) .1. Im JAAT and and she's PRAJAPATI. And also she's from UP but living in jodhpur from the day she was born and I'm natively from Jodhour, RAJASTHAN. Meri behen nai bola ke hamara baap manega nhi iske liye. So she told me bapu ko manana hai tho ameer bn ja kyunki kisi sai bhi shadi kr sktha hai. So i decided to become rich. I'm trying to be an editor and want to start an infotech yt channel (aapka rival ). And even my pasandida aurat is ready to fight with me for our future. .2. Uski height choti hai . Im 6'1 and she's 5'3. Not a big problem but a funny one. ..I'm currently 19 and she's also 19 and I hope we get to marry each other. She's also my first girlfriend and I'm also her 1st boyfriend and I hope I'll be her last and she's also my last. ...I'm in support of intercaste marriages (not only because maine intercaste ladki ko padand kiya hai). But it is the only thing through which intercaste problem can be solved. And it has to start from some where. And my girl is with me in this fight tho drr kiss baat kaa.That's all...

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable.

Unnecessary jokes about PM 2.5 and 56 inch chest comment of our PM, and students wanting to hit teachers. The show seemed to be wanting to become a meme generator. .Also, your newsletters programme was a very good initiative, but free ka recharge feels like a cheap publicity stunt to garner engagement.

Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

Our new neighborhood is mostly Brahmin and Jain families, and we've been experiencing discrimination here, which is really upsetting given that people are supposed to be well-educated...It's frustrating to see how these biases still exist, even in a society that claims to be secular. For example, our neighbors often call their kids by their surnames, which seems like a way to remind us of caste differences and make us feel inferior. This shows that just because someone is financially stable doesn't mean they won't face social issues...We waited our whole lives to buy this house, spending years in rental places and saving up for this moment. But now, instead of enjoying our new home, we're thinking about moving again just to find a more welcoming community...On a positive note, I recently discovered your channel during the elections and found it very impressive.

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

Does she fit the checkmarks of a transgender? No. .The reports say she is a female with DSD. Now whats required is to understand what DSD is, educate your viewers what DSD is and then share your opinion and open thr comments for discussion. .Honestly, i am not an expert, and am equally curious to know more, but shutting the topic with you can change your pronouns but you cannot change your chromosomes is quite disappointing..#you'rebetterthanthis",

One such incident was when I had an attack and couldn't give the mid semester examination, professors refused to accept the report where my condition was mentioned. .This discloses a very serious problem in our system where we do not acknowledge mental illness as an 'illness'. Due to such instances, I had to almost drop a full semester, couldn't complete my courses, attempted suicide. This topic is worth talking about where we acknowledge mental illness as well. The only problem arises is how to determine whether a person had an anxiety attack on a particular day or not, I cannot think of a practical solution in this, but maybe if we raise our voice, we can work on it together.",

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",
            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #recharge_krde_bhai_pls.We got this from a Source that worked in Wedding and they say the wedding was all a mess, because it was very badly planned.\r.\r.Ananya and Hardik were actually together after the barat and it was very loud. Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

If there are 2 people with a an earning of 10k a month and one is from upper caste other from lower caste then in this situation the person belonging to upper caste will seek more respect in that particular society. It doesn't matter how much a  person earn in sc/st community he cannot marry to a person of upper caste . ..There was a teacher of mine who was from sc category and had a job of govt. Teacher but despite having this much incom not a single person from his village came to his marriage . Because he was from sc community . ..I personally support supreme Court's decision . But we need to understand caste is social problem rather than a economical problem. ...Yes I know tha in metro cities money is the only basis on which a person is judged .But what about the people of rural india . In rural india caste is still very prominent . If you will identify some caste{ of sc|st} as uplifted and you don't give them reservation  and if some people in that caste is not that prosperous then they have to suffer in both ways .

Eg. Meena tribe of Rajasthan is classified mainly as OBCs, not ST or some SCs involved in scavenging are more disadvantaged than others.\r.However, implementing a creamy layer policy for SCs and STs is not as straightforward as it is for OBCs. In my experience, many economically well-off SCs and STs still face prejudice due to their caste, which shows that economic status alone doesn't capture the full picture. Therefore, implementing such a policy requires a comprehensive study of both social and financial norms.",

Coming to SC verdict, it is extremely necessary as 70 years of reservations have created a class of Brahmins within the SC community who are now third generation beneficiaries and gobble up all the reserved seats while the truly downtrodden remain unable to avail the facilities originally earmarked for them. The fear is that the intelligentsia within the SC community also comes from the privileged sub-sections and they would use their clout in parliament to dilute the intent of Supreme Court Verdict or set the thresholds of creamy layer at such ridiculous margins that virtually everyone would qualify as non-creamy.",

Now between this two types of candidates when any competition will be taken it's obvious the first one will crack it having better growing opportunities and thus the lower class of sc st ( villages ) remains in the same position. In this way the richer sc st s gets all. ..Now the solution could be this :..During any form fillup the candidate has to submit the pan ID of their parents, from there the income of their parents can be fetched and if the limit crosses then the candidate can't avail the sc st facilities. Then he or she will be treated as a General. Thus a deserving sc st will get all the facilities ( zero form fillup and reservation)..Add on : Documents of electricity bill can also be used cause it shows your financial condition ( for those whose parents are not doing any government job )..Thank you ",

Algeria doesn't support LGBTQ people in the first place. Which is bad but also the case sadly...That previous championship which bans her are discredited by the Olympics. That championship doesn't even explain why she is disqualified. It was an alleged accusation. The Olympics said her to lower her testosterone levels and then she is allowed to participate. After checking testosterone levels, she was allowed now...Researchers and these types match shows that testosterone doesn't give any advantage to people. Yeah it can be lowered too which trans people always do during transition. ..The Tokyo Olympics is the only Olympics where trans women were allowed.

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

Manipur and other north-east States provide us so many good players but our government only remembers them during elections and completely forgots them rest of time. If our government does not address these issues at the ground level, there will be more fewer Olympic Medals.",

Now whats required is to understand what DSD is, educate your viewers what DSD is and then share your opinion and open thr comments for discussion. .Honestly, i am not an expert, and am equally curious to know more, but shutting the topic with you can change your pronouns but you cannot change your chromosomes is quite disappointing..#you'rebetterthanthis",

It has gone to the extent where Khelif had to share photos from her childhood looking very clearly like a girl. She just has higher levels of testosterone than an average female. Lets also remember that Algeria is a very very conservative country so just having these allegations in themselves could be very much a risk to her life in her home country.\r.\r.Meanwhile, the Dutch Volleyball team includes a man who r@ped a 12-year-old, but very few are talking about it.

Bohut log bolte hai intercaste marriage ke bare mein, apne vi bola (main vi chahta hun, next generation ke liye iske bohut fyde hain medial point of view se) likin humare ghar wale manenge nhi kyuki unko varosa nhi upper caste walo par. Past ka stigma upar se tribals mein community others ko accept toh karti nhi upar se jinhone intercaste marriage kar liya unko-unke family members ko functions mein bulate nhi, outcast ghosit kar diya jata hai. Aisa bohut hua hai ki bhag ke shadi ki fir ya toh upper caste walo ne bura bartav Kiya fir wo ladka/ladki ne apni jaan leli ya fir bohut bura kiya uske sath ya fir tribal community se outcast kar diya. Jitna vi ho jai kisi ko outcast kar diya jata hai usko bohut fark padhta hai tumhare bure ya achche waqt mein koi apna nhi, even tumhare baccho ki shadi tak affect hoga....Mere West Bengal main kuch hi aise jagah hai jaha dusre caste se Milne julne pe pabandi lagi hui hai. Mere yaha har dharm ke saath mil jul ke rehte hai hum, unke culture mein ghul chuke hain but jab unki bari aati wo humare culture ka ya toh mazaak udate hai nhi toh apne hisab se rule banake humne sikhane aajate hai. Agar ek caste ke log dusre ke dharm ka respect karenge, niyam janke unka palan karenge & also politicians ya fir kuch so called hindu ya sanatani, dusre dharm ke log  dharm< not everyone >  ke naam pe ladai , vedvav na karenge toh caste system uth sakta hai. Koi caste ka reservation na karke economically reservation hone pe & opportunities pane pe uchi jaat nichi jaat aisa vedvav na karke agar har kisi ko uske achievement ke dam par kaam-recognition mile toh kuch ho sakta hai....Humara vi alag ek dharm hai SARI DHARM, likin hum vi shivji ki puja karte hai bus yehi alag hai ki humara dharm , rules, community sab kuch jungle se juda hua hai. Hum ped paudh-mitti-janwar mein bhagwan ki puja karte hai, humare rituals mandir se bohut  alag hote hai....**Yaha maine caste system ke problem par baat ki hai KISI KE DHARM YA UNKE RITI RIWAJ KO DISRESPECT KARNE KA MERA KOI INTENTION NHI HAI. Har kisi ko apna dharm pyara hai, dharm ka palan karna chahiye. Likin dharm ke naam pe vedvav ya dusre ke upar apna dharm zabardasti lagu karna nhi chahiye.",

Koi caste ka reservation na karke economically reservation hone pe & opportunities pane pe uchi jaat nichi jaat aisa vedvav na karke agar har kisi ko uske achievement ke dam par kaam-recognition mile toh kuch ho sakta hai....Humara vi alag ek dharm hai SARI DHARM, likin hum vi shivji ki puja karte hai bus yehi alag hai ki humara dharm , rules, community sab kuch jungle se juda hua hai. Hum ped paudh-mitti-janwar mein bhagwan ki puja karte hai, humare rituals mandir se bohut  alag hote hai....**Yaha maine caste system ke problem par baat ki hai KISI KE DHARM YA UNKE RITI RIWAJ KO DISRESPECT KARNE KA MERA KOI INTENTION NHI HAI. Har kisi ko apna dharm pyara hai, dharm ka palan karna chahiye. Likin dharm ke naam pe vedvav ya dusre ke upar apna dharm zabardasti lagu karna nhi chahiye.",

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being.

Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8.

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

I am from Maharashtra and there's a reason why Sairat was made in Marathi.

However I think Supreme Court's decision is very right and should be welcomed by all states as I have friends from all the communities and I know they are not on the same level so sub classification will definitely be good step in uplifting the poor but we have seen that due to Pooja Khedkar scam many more people who misused EWS and OBC NCL so there should be strict and transparent system for the sub classification. .Although I am from general category, I support reservation as I have seen the discrimination myself and no particular community is responsible for it but it's a collective failure that we are still stuck in castes when world is talking about equality for all masses, genders and sexualities.

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

            "I strongly oppose the Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2024. This bill is a blatant attempt to stifle freedom of expression and creativity in India. By requiring content creators to obtain licenses and follow strict rules, the government is essentially trying to control what we say and think. This is a clear attack on democracy and our fundamental rights.\r.\r.The fact that even international creators like Taylor Swift and Mr. Beast will be subject to content evaluation committees is absurd. It's a clear example of how this bill will not only harm Indian content creators but also make our country a laughing stock globally.\r.\r.We must stand against this bill and fight for our right to freely express ourselves. We cannot let the government turn us into puppets and dictate what we can and cannot say. The future of our democracy and creative freedom depends on it.",

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",
            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #recharge_krde_bhai_pls.We got this from a Source that worked in Wedding and they say the wedding was all a mess, because it was very badly planned.\r.\r.Ananya and Hardik were actually together after the barat and it was very loud. Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

            "#SundayVichar Namskar Aadam and Welcome to the 5 months recharge plan.1. Olympics controversy:- I think male and females should have their area to play. Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

This video has subtly mentioned a lot of issues and news that are relevant for us and was to the point.

Ha abhi bhi India ke gao me jat -pat me mante he pr sehro me to bo bilkul khatam ho chuka he unke sath to koi discrimination nhi hota to bha se to khatam ho sakti he.. Mere kuch point he is pr - .  .1. Pehla to yehi ki rsevation unhe deni chahiye jinhe jarurat. Mere bahute se yese dost he jinke mami papa sarakari nokri me he or bo sc st catagory ke hone ke karan har chiz me easily select ho jate he. Instead mere papa yek farmer he or me general catagory  ka hu mere pass utne resources  nhi he fir bhi mujhe unke comparision me bhute jada mehnat karni padhti he.  Kisi bhi  exam ka cutoff sc st ke liye general se adha hota he. ..2. Me abhi collage me bsc kr rha hu. Mere  yek sal ki fees 10,000 he. Or  jo sc st bale unki 4000.. Jabki me to 10,000 bhi afford nhi kar sakta bhute muskil se aford kr pa rha hu . .Jinki 4000 he bo easly afford kr sakte he . 10000 se jada to bo mahine ka yese hi udha dete he  but fir bhi reservation  lete he ...3. Or sath me mujhe koi exam form bharne ho  .To meri fees lagti he or unki koi fees nhi lagti ..Yek exam form ki fees meri lagbhag 1000-1500  lagti he or unhe bahi exam free. Me de sakte he..4. Or me abhi ssc gd ki tayri kr rha tha fir form bharne ke time mujhe pata chla ki general ke bacho ke liye  hieght  170 cm honi chahiye  bahi   sc st balo ke liye 152 ya 154 cm chal padhegi . My hieght is 163 cm . Me us din bahute roya.  . . Koi govt. Se support nhi milta jitne resorces he  usme apna 100% deta hu fir bhi selection nhi hota kisi chiz me to dukh hota he or apne hi dost jiske mujhse adhe se bhi kam number aye he  jo yek achi finacial condition se ata he or uska selction ho jata he to kahi na kahi bura to lagta he bhute jada. . Me himachal se yek gao se hu or mujhe pata he ki sc st balo ko reservation  ki jarurat he lakin sabhi ko nhi  hamara gao me top govt. Job bale log sc st bale hi he or kuch sc st bale jinko genualy jarurat he bo iska fayda he ni uthate. Or ham jese general catagury ke boys jinko genualy jarurat he kosis bhi karate he unke liye sarkar kuch nhi  karti .  ..At last srthak bhi lots of love and respect to you ..PLESE MAKE A FULL VIDEO ON THIS INTERVIEWING PEOPLE . .LOVE YOU",

However, this year I discovered your Sunday show, and I immediately fell for it. The way you cover news with a blend of entertainment is simply amazing and making me look forward to every Sunday with great anticipation...Your unique approach to presenting news has rekindled my interest in current events, and I find myself eagerly waiting for each new episode. I love the creativity, humor, and insights you bring to your show. It has become a part of my weekly routine...I was so impressed that I started recommending your channel to my family and friends. Now, not only me, but five of my friends also eagerly await your Sunday show. Today, we all gathered at my place to watch your latest video on TV. We even decided to binge-watch your last 10 Sunday shows, and it was an incredible experience...Your work is truly remarkable, and I want you to know that you have our full support. Keep doing what you're doing; it's making a significant positive impact...Thank you !.Much love and support !",

There was a video of biden that was cropped and shown as if he walks out of the frame when hes supposed to walk somewhere else. This was also incorrect. You should've researched and understood the narrative. You can't make content that is mid anymore.

This isnt an issue of a biological man in womens sports (which i'm against) this is a issue of corruption and racism. Imane was born and raised a woman and has never 'identified' otherwise. Also Algeria is a conservative muslim nation where one couldnt transition even if they wanted to. The Italian boxer has a history of calling out of the match when she is losing.

For example, our neighbors often call their kids by their surnames, which seems like a way to remind us of caste differences and make us feel inferior. This shows that just because someone is financially stable doesn't mean they won't face social issues...We waited our whole lives to buy this house, spending years in rental places and saving up for this moment.

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

She cannot be a Male at this point, cannot be a female, then what is it?..It is absolutely not like she has just identified herself as a Female or gone through a gender change surgery to get unfair advantage, absolutely not. She was brought up as a woman, taught and trained as a woman. competed with women all her life, and when she finally wins, we discriminate her again, because apparently, she has XY chromosomes?..search about DSD sarthak, search about how chromosomes should not identify your sex. because we as 8 billion humans, are born differently, every step of the way...I hope you cover it and feature my comment in the next video. and Let's talk on this matter, it's a serious topic",

I remember that when I was in my school between 2006 and 2013, even some teachers wouldn't touch us. Things have slowly changed, but those born between 1960 and 1990 still hold those attitudes. However, the generation born in the after 90s is different. I have friends from General, OBC, and ST categories, and while in their family (parents or elder) not allow me to enter into their homes. my friends come over to mine, and we eat together. It's disheartening that, even today, 95% of our villagers families still practice discrimination. This mindset needs to change; nothing bad will happen if people from different backgrounds interact. But the older generation, those in their 60s and older, don't understand because this has been passed down through generations. What's your take on this sarthak bhai.

We need more awareness for these kinds of sports. I was recently selected for international competition in New Zealand, but the government gave no funding for that, hence many fencers like me did not go. Huge sports politics are involved.

Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9.

These events highlight that the revolt in Bangladesh extends beyond the reservation system, suggesting deeper, more sinister motives potentially aimed at harming India. Given that Sheikh Hasina has openly declared her friendship with India, it seems anti-Indian elements may be involved.

            "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

This isnt an issue of a biological man in womens sports (which i'm against) this is a issue of corruption and racism. Imane was born and raised a woman and has never 'identified' otherwise. Also Algeria is a conservative muslim nation where one couldnt transition even if they wanted to. The Italian boxer has a history of calling out of the match when she is losing.

However, the generation born in the after 90s is different. I have friends from General, OBC, and ST categories, and while in their family (parents or elder) not allow me to enter into their homes. my friends come over to mine, and we eat together. It's disheartening that, even today, 95% of our villagers families still practice discrimination. This mindset needs to change; nothing bad will happen if people from different backgrounds interact. But the older generation, those in their 60s and older, don't understand because this has been passed down through generations. What's your take on this sarthak bhai.

            "#SundayVichar Namskar Aadam and Welcome to the 5 months recharge plan.1. Olympics controversy:- I think male and females should have their area to play. Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

            "#reservationlaw i personally believe reservation is fine until and unless kisi gareeb family ke bache ko ya fir kisi pichde varg ke bache ko mile kisi ka bhala ho rha usse mereko takleef  nai hai but it is wrong when koi bacha Jo mere sath meri hi coaching mien padh rha usse reservation mil jaye kyunki vo toh coaching afford kar pa rha we both used same resources then why one get more advantage. Secondly nowadays government are introducing alot of reservations just to win elections which is wrong each and every person should be treated alike and the main points to consider while giving reservation should be income or any physical disability. I believe reservation was just a temporary solution but now government is trying to make it permanent which is simply not possible. Government should try to take some others steps like providing free and quality education to everyone. Honestly I believe SC has taken a right step it provides a more fair chance to everyone and now more deserving candidates will get reservation.

            "Hi Sarthak,..First and foremost, thank you for the amazing work you and your team do. Your content is so engaging that I wish it were a daily dive into the news instead of just weekly. Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

Bohut log bolte hai intercaste marriage ke bare mein, apne vi bola (main vi chahta hun, next generation ke liye iske bohut fyde hain medial point of view se) likin humare ghar wale manenge nhi kyuki unko varosa nhi upper caste walo par. Past ka stigma upar se tribals mein community others ko accept toh karti nhi upar se jinhone intercaste marriage kar liya unko-unke family members ko functions mein bulate nhi, outcast ghosit kar diya jata hai. Aisa bohut hua hai ki bhag ke shadi ki fir ya toh upper caste walo ne bura bartav Kiya fir wo ladka/ladki ne apni jaan leli ya fir bohut bura kiya uske sath ya fir tribal community se outcast kar diya. Jitna vi ho jai kisi ko outcast kar diya jata hai usko bohut fark padhta hai tumhare bure ya achche waqt mein koi apna nhi, even tumhare baccho ki shadi tak affect hoga....Mere West Bengal main kuch hi aise jagah hai jaha dusre caste se Milne julne pe pabandi lagi hui hai. Mere yaha har dharm ke saath mil jul ke rehte hai hum, unke culture mein ghul chuke hain but jab unki bari aati wo humare culture ka ya toh mazaak udate hai nhi toh apne hisab se rule banake humne sikhane aajate hai. Agar ek caste ke log dusre ke dharm ka respect karenge, niyam janke unka palan karenge & also politicians ya fir kuch so called hindu ya sanatani, dusre dharm ke log  dharm< not everyone >  ke naam pe ladai , vedvav na karenge toh caste system uth sakta hai.

This isnt an issue of a biological man in womens sports (which i'm against) this is a issue of corruption and racism. Imane was born and raised a woman and has never 'identified' otherwise.

Her gender or testosterone levels were never questioned, and she has no particularly stellar record, although she has been improving recently. She was tested at the 2022 World Championships, found no issues, and took the silver medal without incident. At the 2023 World Championships, after defeating a Russian boxer in the Round of 16, she was suddenly declared ineligible based on tests from 2022 and 2023. The International Boxing Association (IBA), which oversees these championships, has a history of corruption, financial dependence on Russian-owned Gazprom, and a controversial Russian president elected in 2020. The IOC severed ties with the IBA due to these issues, and multiple countries boycotted the 2023 World Championships. The IBA claimed Khelif had XY chromosomes based on a 2022 test, yet allowed her to compete until she beat a Russian athlete. There was no evidence of elevated testosterone, and no prior eligibility issues. .She is 100% female who spent her whole life training to be the best female boxer, and just because her opponent felt pain and wasn’t strong enough to fight such a professional boxer she started to say that the Algerian boxer is a MAN and  most people went along with her?!!

Now whats required is to understand what DSD is, educate your viewers what DSD is and then share your opinion and open thr comments for discussion. .Honestly, i am not an expert, and am equally curious to know more, but shutting the topic with you can change your pronouns but you cannot change your chromosomes is quite disappointing..#you'rebetterthanthis",

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

            "#ReservationLaw Excellent decision by our cji of introducing creamy layer criteria into sc/st too. i personally feel this was much needed as a general category student, i know that some people are still marginalised and they deserve these kinds of reservation for their social and economic upliftment but from past few years what was happening is i'll explain it by giving one example. one of my friend belongs to sc caste, his mother is a govt. high school teacher with the salary of 90k-1.2lac per month and his father is an govt civil engineer with almost same pay scale. summing up monthly salary of his parents is around 2.5-3lacs per month. he has studied in top notch cbse school of my city with an yearly fee of 1lac, he was in the best tuition of our city and still he used his sc quota and got into iit with just 50-60percentile whereas i got 80percentile in mains but still suffered to get a good college and if you would compare monthly salary of my parents then it is around 60k per month(my mother is an housewife) but the hypocricy is although my parent income is under 8 lakhs (60*12=7.2lakh) i can't get ews reservation bcoz my father is a police officer(head constable) so why did my friend got the sc reservation despite the fact that both of his parents are in government jobs and with the pay scale of almost 2.5 lacs combinely. i was really happy yesterday when i heared the news but after an hour one thought strucked into my mind which was if supreme court introduces creamy layer then those sc students will be counted as general and they will fight for general seats which will lead to increase in competition of the general seats which is really disappointing. central govt must do the caste census and take actions as per the data(like lower the reservation percentage) this is really needed!!!!!!",
            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

Having a high level of testosterone because of dsd doesn't make her a man, just naturally gifted. Michael Phelps has a bigger wingspan than the average male and Michael Jordan is taller than an avg person so they shouldn't be playing because they have an unfair advantage. That doesn't make sense. They were banned last time because of a single man and his corrupt ideology and he has been removed from the committee. Same thing happened to our Dutee Chand.

I met my beautiful girl  in first year its was 12th October 2022. It was our first day vo BBA wali mai BCOM wala hamare batch mai 499 londe the tho mai or mere dost bs yuhi BBA mai nikal gye and there i met her........ She was(is) stunning. As beautiful as the northern lights and as cute as a baby. Then i tried to talk to her i got her number and her insta and we started talking and in feb 2023 i told her for first time that i like you and would love to be in relationship with you. She said no . .Pr vo mard he kya jo haar maan jaye. .So I still tried to convense her and in November she finally told me. I would like to be in relationship with you. And for first time in my life I cried that day. Then we met on 7th December to watch movie as both of our birthday parties ( uska 5 or mera 6). For the first time i hold her hand. It was like heaven. Then we started meeting regularly or dekhte he dekhte mai uska pasandida mard bn gaya or vo tho pheli nazar sai he meri pasandida aurat thi. .But.My sister had 2 problems with her 1 big and another one small (and funny) .1. Im JAAT and and she's PRAJAPATI. And also she's from UP but living in jodhpur from the day she was born and I'm natively from Jodhour, RAJASTHAN. Meri behen nai bola ke hamara baap manega nhi iske liye. So she told me bapu ko manana hai tho ameer bn ja kyunki kisi sai bhi shadi kr sktha hai. So i decided to become rich. I'm trying to be an editor and want to start an infotech yt channel (aapka rival ). And even my pasandida aurat is ready to fight with me for our future. .2. Uski height choti hai . Im 6'1 and she's 5'3. Not a big problem but a funny one. ..I'm currently 19 and she's also 19 and I hope we get to marry each other. She's also my first girlfriend and I'm also her 1st boyfriend and I hope I'll be her last and she's also my last. ...I'm in support of intercaste marriages (not only because maine intercaste ladki ko padand kiya hai). But it is the only thing through which intercaste problem can be solved. And it has to start from some where. And my girl is with me in this fight tho drr kiss baat kaa.That's all...

            "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

Both of these women (including Lin Yu-ting) are neither trans athletes nor anything else that indicates they changed their gender. They were born biological women (as far as the facts are reported). People calling them men is not in good taste, at least until it is proven otherwise...2. The whole thing started with the IBA ban in the World Championship, for which we have no idea what tests were done on these women. The IBA says testosterone was not tested; they only said both had the Y chromosome (what test? no idea). Between one and two percent of the population has variations in sex biology. Some studies estimate that about 1 in 15,000 women have Y chromosomes in some or all of their cells. Some of those women with Y chromosomes have high testosterone, some don't. And again, we have no idea whether either of these particular women have high testosterone because that test has not been done. Many people are arguing that these women have high testosterone. We simply do not know whether that is true or not...3. If they are actually biological women and have a biological advantage, why should we punish them? Michael Phelps's physical advantages, such as his arm span and reduced lactic acid production, have not led to disqualification but rather celebrated his unique capabilities within the sport. That does not mean Michael Phelps has not done the hard work, and neither have these women.",

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable.

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

Aisa bohut hua hai ki bhag ke shadi ki fir ya toh upper caste walo ne bura bartav Kiya fir wo ladka/ladki ne apni jaan leli ya fir bohut bura kiya uske sath ya fir tribal community se outcast kar diya.

And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being.

These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8.

They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4.

I believe reservation was just a temporary solution but now government is trying to make it permanent which is simply not possible. Government should try to take some others steps like providing free and quality education to everyone. Honestly I believe SC has taken a right step it provides a more fair chance to everyone and now more deserving candidates will get reservation.

And secondly, *Manipur,* one of India's most sporting states, which gifts Olympic winners like Mary Kom and Mirabai Chanu, has riots throughout the year.

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you.

            "#ReservationLaw Excellent decision by our cji of introducing creamy layer criteria into sc/st too. i personally feel this was much needed as a general category student, i know that some people are still marginalised and they deserve these kinds of reservation for their social and economic upliftment but from past few years what was happening is i'll explain it by giving one example. one of my friend belongs to sc caste, his mother is a govt. high school teacher with the salary of 90k-1.2lac per month and his father is an govt civil engineer with almost same pay scale. summing up monthly salary of his parents is around 2.5-3lacs per month. he has studied in top notch cbse school of my city with an yearly fee of 1lac, he was in the best tuition of our city and still he used his sc quota and got into iit with just 50-60percentile whereas i got 80percentile in mains but still suffered to get a good college and if you would compare monthly salary of my parents then it is around 60k per month(my mother is an housewife) but the hypocricy is although my parent income is under 8 lakhs (60*12=7.2lakh) i can't get ews reservation bcoz my father is a police officer(head constable) so why did my friend got the sc reservation despite the fact that both of his parents are in government jobs and with the pay scale of almost 2.5 lacs combinely. i was really happy yesterday when i heared the news but after an hour one thought strucked into my mind which was if supreme court introduces creamy layer then those sc students will be counted as general and they will fight for general seats which will lead to increase in competition of the general seats which is really disappointing. central govt must do the caste census and take actions as per the data(like lower the reservation percentage) this is really needed!!!!!!",

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

And secondly, *Manipur,* one of India's most sporting states, which gifts Olympic winners like Mary Kom and Mirabai Chanu, has riots throughout the year. Manipur and other north-east States provide us so many good players but our government only remembers them during elections and completely forgots them rest of time.

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you.

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being.

This helps people invest their money at lower risk and get better returns than traditional investment options. People can start a sip or one time investment in a mutual fund.",

Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable.

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

            "#parisolympic Sarthak, I agree with you on why Indian won a few *Olympic Medals.* And to that I would like to add two big reasons. First,  our country's athletes do not get respect even after winning Olympic and more international medals. You can remember our *Wrestlers' protest.* In my opinion, not getting justice for serious allegations like sexual abuse of wrestlers is a big discouragement for players, especially for female players..  And secondly, *Manipur,* one of India's most sporting states, which gifts Olympic winners like Mary Kom and Mirabai Chanu, has riots throughout the year. Manipur and other north-east States provide us so many good players but our government only remembers them during elections and completely forgots them rest of time. If our government does not address these issues at the ground level, there will be more fewer Olympic Medals.",

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",
            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #recharge_krde_bhai_pls.We got this from a Source that worked in Wedding and they say the wedding was all a mess, because it was very badly planned.\r.\r.Ananya and Hardik were actually together after the barat and it was very loud. Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

            "#parisolympics.Family says, Don't play only study...Public only watches cricket matches...BCCI gets more money than all other sports combined..Sports funding from the government is bare minimum..Many award winners are living in poverty..Then we ask, why don't we win more medals in the Olympics!.. It's my third time witnessing the after olympics reactions on social media. every time they talked  about fewer medals from the olympics , then after the olympics , they will again start supporting cricket only..It's the public ignorance towards other sports all the time is the reason for less medals being 1.4B people. .Like Odisha sponsored Indian Hockey Teams in all formats, if other states sponsored one one sport each, the scenario would be something else.",
            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

I support your effort to try and educate people and get them engaged in current affairs so please know that I mean no hate towards you. But this is the second time I am trying to address a lack of understanding in gender theory from you. In this case especially the terf ideology (JK Rowling’s brand of feminism) has now actually targeted a cis-woman not even a trans woman. While an actually convicted rapist is also being allowed to participate and no major news outlets and incels on the internet are actually speaking up on it. Shows how much they actually care about women’s safety as opposed to furthering their insecure agenda. I think you should gain a more professional opinion in this subject or atleast have your team do more research before you inform someone on subjects like this. You are responsible for a large audience many of whom are impressionable youngsters who are looking for a way to build their ideology. It is important for you to have as clean of a perspective as you can have on these topics",

Now, he retired while I was still studying in school(senior secondary). And the thing is he is not getting his full pension, because he got govt. job very late in his life so ofc he was suppose to get low pension compared to ppl who joined earlier.

As beautiful as the northern lights and as cute as a baby. Then i tried to talk to her i got her number and her insta and we started talking and in feb 2023 i told her for first time that i like you and would love to be in relationship with you. She said no . .Pr vo mard he kya jo haar maan jaye. .So I still tried to convense her and in November she finally told me. I would like to be in relationship with you.

Then we started meeting regularly or dekhte he dekhte mai uska pasandida mard bn gaya or vo tho pheli nazar sai he meri pasandida aurat thi. .But.My sister had 2 problems with her 1 big and another one small (and funny) .1.

Im 6'1 and she's 5'3. Not a big problem but a funny one. ..I'm currently 19 and she's also 19 and I hope we get to marry each other. She's also my first girlfriend and I'm also her 1st boyfriend and I hope I'll be her last and she's also my last. ...I'm in support of intercaste marriages (not only because maine intercaste ladki ko padand kiya hai).

But they didn't listen. .Please tell me something about it brother please only u can tell me please please please   all the faculties whom I was connected with they seeing me like I have done something wrong. They think I have the wrong eye for them.. but I know I will never be able  to prove myself to them .. those teachers  were very friendly with me.. they were supporting me in everything because I was good in studies but after this news they are behaving like strangers.. their words are like I didn't expect this from you.. it hurts .. is keeping condoms in my personal luggage bag is soo much big issue??

            "I am 3 times national level medalist ( 1 gold in SGFI National level ) in silambam ( Indian martial arts) after covid whole silambam association in dead no more nationals are happening and it is very ancient sports of india and believe me it is not easy to play just watch videos on it on yt. After winning national level gold my scholarship amt of 21k came to me after 1.5 years of waiting. And forgot abt state level championships all of the players have to sleep on the floor 50 guys in a room and the food we got lets just not go there, we have to drink tap water for straight 5 day. Every athlete in this country has to go through infinite struggle there are soo many problems regarding sports in this country if i started talking abt that it will take hours, as of now i have stopped playing after covid as i also have to support financially, and now all the sports i play is cricket, football and badminton in turf….esa lgra hai kitna boldu but it’s never going to get over, so next time you see any sports players ( if they have represented your state or nation in any sports) try to respect them they have to go through a lot to reach there.. also i am straight 7 times state level gold medalist for the straight 7 years but got to play only 3 nationals and thats a whole different story,…….. peace",

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out. And Love Your Content Sarthak Ji",

            "Unsafe workspaces are a big problem in Delhi-NCR. Places like Malviya Nagar and Hauz Khas have tons of studios and offices in basements with no emergency exits. A few years ago, I rented an office in Malviya Nagar’s Corner Market. One day, a fire broke out because of bad electrical wiring. Luckily, it was a holiday, so there weren’t many people around, and no one got hurt. Even though the Fire Department and MCD sealed the place, it was back open for business within a week after the owner bribed the officials. The same thing happened again a few months later, causing injuries, and once again, the owner used bribes to avoid any real consequences. To top it off, the guy even started a cloud kitchen in that building. That was when I decided to pack up and leave. It’s clear that government departments aren’t doing their job properly in this country.",

I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety along with other disorders and had to go through many anxiety attacks in between ongoing semesters. One such incident was when I had an attack and couldn't give the mid semester examination, professors refused to accept the report where my condition was mentioned. .This discloses a very serious problem in our system where we do not acknowledge mental illness as an 'illness'. Due to such instances, I had to almost drop a full semester, couldn't complete my courses, attempted suicide. This topic is worth talking about where we acknowledge mental illness as well. The only problem arises is how to determine whether a person had an anxiety attack on a particular day or not, I cannot think of a practical solution in this, but maybe if we raise our voice, we can work on it together.",
            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

It was our first day vo BBA wali mai BCOM wala hamare batch mai 499 londe the tho mai or mere dost bs yuhi BBA mai nikal gye and there i met her........ She was(is) stunning. As beautiful as the northern lights and as cute as a baby. Then i tried to talk to her i got her number and her insta and we started talking and in feb 2023 i told her for first time that i like you and would love to be in relationship with you. She said no . .Pr vo mard he kya jo haar maan jaye. .So I still tried to convense her and in November she finally told me. I would like to be in relationship with you. And for first time in my life I cried that day. Then we met on 7th December to watch movie as both of our birthday parties ( uska 5 or mera 6). For the first time i hold her hand. It was like heaven. Then we started meeting regularly or dekhte he dekhte mai uska pasandida mard bn gaya or vo tho pheli nazar sai he meri pasandida aurat thi. .But.My sister had 2 problems with her 1 big and another one small (and funny) .1. Im JAAT and and she's PRAJAPATI. And also she's from UP but living in jodhpur from the day she was born and I'm natively from Jodhour, RAJASTHAN. Meri behen nai bola ke hamara baap manega nhi iske liye. So she told me bapu ko manana hai tho ameer bn ja kyunki kisi sai bhi shadi kr sktha hai. So i decided to become rich. I'm trying to be an editor and want to start an infotech yt channel (aapka rival ). And even my pasandida aurat is ready to fight with me for our future. .2. Uski height choti hai . Im 6'1 and she's 5'3. Not a big problem but a funny one. ..I'm currently 19 and she's also 19 and I hope we get to marry each other. She's also my first girlfriend and I'm also her 1st boyfriend and I hope I'll be her last and she's also my last. ...I'm in support of intercaste marriages (not only because maine intercaste ladki ko padand kiya hai). But it is the only thing through which intercaste problem can be solved. And it has to start from some where. And my girl is with me in this fight tho drr kiss baat kaa.That's all...

Later, she won the case and was cleared to race again. The point I want to make is that it is not as simple as male and female. There are rigorous committees that guide these big events. Furthermore, she is a biological female at the end of the day who has female reproductive organs and just outrightly saying that it is unfair because she is a man would be a disservice to the efforts that she has put in for the sport. #parisolympics",

This helps people invest their money at lower risk and get better returns than traditional investment options. People can start a sip or one time investment in a mutual fund.",

And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable.

People calling them men is not in good taste, at least until it is proven otherwise...2. The whole thing started with the IBA ban in the World Championship, for which we have no idea what tests were done on these women. The IBA says testosterone was not tested; they only said both had the Y chromosome (what test? no idea). Between one and two percent of the population has variations in sex biology. Some studies estimate that about 1 in 15,000 women have Y chromosomes in some or all of their cells. Some of those women with Y chromosomes have high testosterone, some don't. And again, we have no idea whether either of these particular women have high testosterone because that test has not been done. Many people are arguing that these women have high testosterone. We simply do not know whether that is true or not...3. If they are actually biological women and have a biological advantage, why should we punish them?

The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

            "Title your video: MISINFORMATION...There is no proof of the Algerian boxer having XY chromosomes, this was just a claim by the former IBA russian president with none of the results being published. IOA banned IBA in 2019 citing unfair governance practices. The boxer was banned by IBA after she BEAT a russian boxer in the 2023 championships. Smell any conspiracy yet?..Why was she not banned before the start of the 2023 tournament if she indeed had XY chromosomes? Did this ever cross your mind?..This is just racism where society is conditioned to have a preconceived notion about how women/men should look. And unfortunately, schmucks like you pour oil in the fire...Your narrow mindset is prevalent in the comical manner in which you say pronouns to badal loge par biology ka kya. Seriously?

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out. And Love Your Content Sarthak Ji",

            "#reservation.I have seen people talking against reservation all the time but are not willing to give equal rights and respect to everyone. I am from Maharashtra and there's a reason why Sairat was made in Marathi. I feel ashamed to see that people not just General but even OBC, SC and minorities are so obsessed about their castes that they even willing to go to the extent of murdering their own daughters and son in law. However I think Supreme Court's decision is very right and should be welcomed by all states as I have friends from all the communities and I know they are not on the same level so sub classification will definitely be good step in uplifting the poor but we have seen that due to Pooja Khedkar scam many more people who misused EWS and OBC NCL so there should be strict and transparent system for the sub classification. .Although I am from general category, I support reservation as I have seen the discrimination myself and no particular community is responsible for it but it's a collective failure that we are still stuck in castes when world is talking about equality for all masses, genders and sexualities. I pledge that I will never discriminate or be quiet after seeing discrimination of my fellow brothers and sisters on the basis of caste, creed, religion, language, region, gender or race.

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

Class can be changed on economic basis, that is, earning more (or less).. but caste can't be abandoned in India.. you can earn more (or less), but you'll still be of same caste. If you belong to lower caste, there's a chance that you'll still be discriminated in the social strata (Just look at or search for the recent caste based discrimination cases that were filed). Now the question arises, will there still be discrimination in the society based on caste? If the ANSWER IS YES, I see NO POINT IN THIS RESERVATION REFORM. but if the  ANSWER IS NO..

            "#InvestmentPlan ..One thing I've learned in the last three years of working is that our approach to investments often isn't the best. You can't build wealth with a ₹500 SIP. Instead, invest that ₹500 in yourself through courses or books that suit you. Once you start making good money, you'll be able to invest more significantly and see better returns. Nobody got rich with a ₹500 SIP...People are willing to spend 10-20 lakhs on formal education but hesitate to invest ₹5000 in a course that can bring opportunities worth lakhs. How ironic! Investing in yourself is the best way forward, especially early in your career...Coming to the 100 ruppes, vaise toh Sarthak bhaiya free mey recharge de rahe hai but with that 100, I'll access the internet.

She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

Even the staff outside the changing room could hear them.\r.\r.Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan left the venue as soon as the wedding functions were over on both days. They seemed to be arguing over things on the first day.\r.\r.Nita Ambani had a mental breakdown when she realized that very few Celebs and no A listers attended the Mangal utsav. She actually made her assistants call celebrities and ask why they would not be present.\r.\r.Shokla Ambani was sidelined from the entire functions and BTS Nita is quite rude and towards Shloka. Shloka really seemed tired but Nita was being really rude to her.\r.\r.True or not about their open marriage Ranveer Singh situation, but he was flirting with everyone, including many foreigners present and it was very unbearable.\r.\r.Janhvi kapoor has some serious beef with Sara Ali khan because she kept ignoring her. Whereas Ibrahim is treated very differently by the others.\r.\r.Palak and Ibrahim’s relationship may be true but that did not stop him from flirting and being very cheesy with others attending the event.\r.\r.Aryan khans girlfriend is some Hollywood producers daughter whose half Indian and European. And she was on a VVIP list even there were separate gates for them to enter where even paps like viral bhayani and others weren’t allowed to enter. Got to know her name from his sub and asked a friend who was managing the VVIP list they confirmed her name is Lakeisha Palha. She belongs to some European royal family. Abram was with her both days she attended.\r.\r.The Royal families of Dubai and many others were invited and present though not papped since they all has a separate entrance.\r.\r.Khushi kapoor broke down a few times during the barat no idea why, but her boyfriend Vedang Raina kept consoling her. (Probably her hideous).\r.\r.Kirti Sanon and Jaya bachan got into a serious argument after the first day functions were over. And Jaya being Jaya she just kept rambling things not realizing there were staff around.\r.\r.Alia and Ranbir seemed like they got in a serious fight and attended the wedding. He kept telling her to be behave properly. And Alia did not wrong she just wanted to be close to her husband.\r.\r.Ananya pushing Nick jonas was not actually the way the videos seem to be. Yes ananya was craving all the attention but she was drunk and I think it was more because of that. Then anything intentional.\r.\r.Arjun and Kusha on the last day did not interact with each other much but they kept looking st each other in s weird way. Like there was some tea there.\r.\r.Suhana and Agastya may actually be dating because after her second change on day 1, she was mostly with him. I don’t think their relationship will last but as of now they really are together.\r.\r.Akash Ambani is a prick he treats staff like crap and even expects them to keep making excuses on his behalf of why he suddenly does missing in between functions.\r.\r.This one sounds really weird but Amitabh Bacchan couldn’t stop staring at Kim kardashian and you know her what. Jaya had to keep telling him to stop ogling.\r.\r.Yash attended the first 2 days as well but chose to enter from the VVIP entrance where he was not papped.\r.\r.Alcohol and non veg was served in certain food courts. So food bloggers putting up stories that it was only a veg menu is not true.\r.\r.Cannot verify this, but the styling team said that not all jewellery the Ambani’s wore were not real diamonds since real diamonds would weigh a lot specially earrings and the jewellery was really light.\r.\r.Deepika is actually pregnant and it shows on her face. She gets tired very quickly and Ranveer Singh does not really seem to care. She was with her mother for most of the event.\r.\r.Anil Ambani and family were not asked to be part of ant of the family photographs.\r.\r.And Orry is a total pain in the ass. He thinks he can treat staff however he likes. A staff member at end of day 2 actually retorted to his abusive language since he was being very rude and racial and she was thrown out of her job.\r.\r.24 The amount being put up on social media about anants sherwani being in crores is not true. Even Raddhika’s outfit was priced at around 30L. Nothing was on crores.",

            "29:30 Sarthak Bhai, .I frankly don't believe that India's obsession with cricket is the only, or even the biggest reason for the lack of focus on other sports. Because, even cricket is not a 'Government' supported sport. The BCCI, although filled with politicains, is still a board which gets money from investors and sponsorships. The main reason I belive for the lack of focus in other sports is the lack of results. India I believe is a very result oriented country. Before 1983, no one payed any importance to cricket in this nation. It was only after a world-cup victory that cricket skyrocketed in popularity. (This is from what I hear and learnt from sources. I was not alive that time, so this might be wrong) .But, an event I have first hand experience of is when Neeraj Chopra won a Gold in Javelin throw, suddenly the entire nation became obsessed with the sport. When Vishwanath Anand became a grandmaster, we were suddenly reintroduced to a sport that we created and then forgot. .The next Fifa world cup qualification was stolen from India due to a controversial decision and there was a lot of outrage in India. So, I don't think it would be farfetched to say, if India had even qualified for the world cup, the support would have been unreal. The qualification would have been a result in of itself..As a sports fan, one can genuinely not follow everything, but I follow cricket and baseball. And, I'll be saying that in terms of quality Indian baseball is far behind other teams of similar ranking. And it isn't surprising to see that most people don't even know that India has a baseball team, since there are no results..Thus, in my opinion, it's not the obsession with cricket, but the obsession with results that isn't allowing India to get a good result.",

However, I've observed that due to shorter attention span, the students do not engage in long form content, even if it is entertaining like yours'.

            "#SundayVichar Namskar Aadam and Welcome to the 5 months recharge plan.1. Olympics controversy:- I think male and females should have their area to play. Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

            "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

However I think Supreme Court's decision is very right and should be welcomed by all states as I have friends from all the communities and I know they are not on the same level so sub classification will definitely be good step in uplifting the poor but we have seen that due to Pooja Khedkar scam many more people who misused EWS and OBC NCL so there should be strict and transparent system for the sub classification. .Although I am from general category, I support reservation as I have seen the discrimination myself and no particular community is responsible for it but it's a collective failure that we are still stuck in castes when world is talking about equality for all masses, genders and sexualities. I pledge that I will never discriminate or be quiet after seeing discrimination of my fellow brothers and sisters on the basis of caste, creed, religion, language, region, gender or race.

The show seemed to be wanting to become a meme generator. .Also, your newsletters programme was a very good initiative, but free ka recharge feels like a cheap publicity stunt to garner engagement. I hope you find better ways to generate revenue. I apologise if I'm being too harsh but the Sunday Show is a truly a breath of fresh air in the climate of toxic news and its sad to see it lose its USP. .Best of luck",

            "Hi Sarthak,..First and foremost, thank you for the amazing work you and your team do. Your content is so engaging that I wish it were a daily dive into the news instead of just weekly. Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards.",

I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

            "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

In this case especially the terf ideology (JK Rowling’s brand of feminism) has now actually targeted a cis-woman not even a trans woman. While an actually convicted rapist is also being allowed to participate and no major news outlets and incels on the internet are actually speaking up on it. Shows how much they actually care about women’s safety as opposed to furthering their insecure agenda.

This is perpetuated only by the Dalit intellectuals who want the whole reservation available for themselves and their children and have a vested interest in not allowing the weaker subsections of the community a separate share from the quota pie.

The actual fee is around 80k sc/st irrespective of their income have to pay only 3000, yes 3k and EWS have to pay 70000, 70k .So why do we give a caste based angle to reservation and not only see income as factor to differentiate between people when it comes to reservation. Like people who cannot afford things need to be give reservation and not the one whose ancestors have suffered but they are living happily and have a good income.",

Secondly nowadays government are introducing alot of reservations just to win elections which is wrong each and every person should be treated alike and the main points to consider while giving reservation should be income or any physical disability. I believe reservation was just a temporary solution but now government is trying to make it permanent which is simply not possible. Government should try to take some others steps like providing free and quality education to everyone. Honestly I believe SC has taken a right step it provides a more fair chance to everyone and now more deserving candidates will get reservation.

Bohut log bolte hai intercaste marriage ke bare mein, apne vi bola (main vi chahta hun, next generation ke liye iske bohut fyde hain medial point of view se) likin humare ghar wale manenge nhi kyuki unko varosa nhi upper caste walo par. Past ka stigma upar se tribals mein community others ko accept toh karti nhi upar se jinhone intercaste marriage kar liya unko-unke family members ko functions mein bulate nhi, outcast ghosit kar diya jata hai. Aisa bohut hua hai ki bhag ke shadi ki fir ya toh upper caste walo ne bura bartav Kiya fir wo ladka/ladki ne apni jaan leli ya fir bohut bura kiya uske sath ya fir tribal community se outcast kar diya. Jitna vi ho jai kisi ko outcast kar diya jata hai usko bohut fark padhta hai tumhare bure ya achche waqt mein koi apna nhi, even tumhare baccho ki shadi tak affect hoga....Mere West Bengal main kuch hi aise jagah hai jaha dusre caste se Milne julne pe pabandi lagi hui hai. Mere yaha har dharm ke saath mil jul ke rehte hai hum, unke culture mein ghul chuke hain but jab unki bari aati wo humare culture ka ya toh mazaak udate hai nhi toh apne hisab se rule banake humne sikhane aajate hai. Agar ek caste ke log dusre ke dharm ka respect karenge, niyam janke unka palan karenge & also politicians ya fir kuch so called hindu ya sanatani, dusre dharm ke log  dharm< not everyone >  ke naam pe ladai , vedvav na karenge toh caste system uth sakta hai. Koi caste ka reservation na karke economically reservation hone pe & opportunities pane pe uchi jaat nichi jaat aisa vedvav na karke agar har kisi ko uske achievement ke dam par kaam-recognition mile toh kuch ho sakta hai....Humara vi alag ek dharm hai SARI DHARM, likin hum vi shivji ki puja karte hai bus yehi alag hai ki humara dharm , rules, community sab kuch jungle se juda hua hai.

Instead, invest that ₹500 in yourself through courses or books that suit you. Once you start making good money, you'll be able to invest more significantly and see better returns. Nobody got rich with a ₹500 SIP...People are willing to spend 10-20 lakhs on formal education but hesitate to invest ₹5000 in a course that can bring opportunities worth lakhs. How ironic! Investing in yourself is the best way forward, especially early in your career...Coming to the 100 ruppes, vaise toh Sarthak bhaiya free mey recharge de rahe hai but with that 100, I'll access the internet.

            "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

            "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

Despite the controversy, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and organizations like GLAAD and InterACT have confirmed her gender identity as female.

They said that her testosterone levels are high. ..She takes it to the court and it is found that testosterone levels don't make someone more powerful. Also imane khelif is already many times defeated by a female boxer...Imane khelif is not male or trans women. They are literally not allowed to participate in sports. Trans men are allowed but trans women aren't allowed. She was born as a female, grew up like a female and is a female...She has higher testosterone levels which mind you can be lowered. Every woman has some kind of testosterone levels. She just has a higher level...Also go and learn about intersex people before spreading misinformation. Algeria doesn't support LGBTQ people in the first place. Which is bad but also the case sadly...That previous championship which bans her are discredited by the Olympics. That championship doesn't even explain why she is disqualified. It was an alleged accusation. The Olympics said her to lower her testosterone levels and then she is allowed to participate. After checking testosterone levels, she was allowed now...Researchers and these types match shows that testosterone doesn't give any advantage to people. Yeah it can be lowered too which trans people always do during transition. ..The Tokyo Olympics is the only Olympics where trans women were allowed. And that trans women still gets defeated by actual women in weightlifting fo all places...Isn't men has more advantage? Why a woman defeated her when her opponent has born male, huh.",

And it's totally fair because it's not the case of born as male and identifying as female.

Your views complies with monsters like rowling and musk, that saying a lot. Also, IBA mandates means nothing. Because they're a fraud organization. Imane is a born female but have higher testosterone. Still not exceeding hormonal criteria of olympics. Having natural advantages is very normal in sports, from felps to bolt. This time a white women gets beaten so you see western hemisphere is boiling also there is xenophobic discrimination against khelif. Khelif was many times defeated by amy and other white cis women boxer. So this incident is a skill issue from carini. Learn the truth before spreading right wing propaganda in the name of news!",

The IOC (International Olympic Committee) has likely conducted medical tests on her before allowing her to compete in the Olympics, which would have required her to lower her testosterone levels to the required threshold...There is no need for a caste-specific census, as all necessary information can be determined through a regular census.
