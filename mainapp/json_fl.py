        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being.

        "Hey Sarthak bhai, the Olympian female who happens to have higher testosterone level, doesn't exactly have XY chromosome problem. IBA said she was disqualified for unknown test which is suspicious. The president of IBA was Russian and guess when this happened, right after Imane defeated Russian undefeated boxer. Speculation aside, they should specify the grounds for disqualification. I really don't like how everyone jumped on her at this problem.",

        "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree.",

But today it was not of the quality that you and your team are known for. There was a tasteless joke about husband killing his wife over mobile hotspot. Unnecessary jokes about PM 2.5 and 56 inch chest comment of our PM, and students wanting to hit teachers. The show seemed to be wanting to become a meme generator. .Also, your newsletters programme was a very good initiative, but free ka recharge feels like a cheap publicity stunt to garner engagement. I hope you find better ways to generate revenue. I apologise if I'm being too harsh but the Sunday Show is a truly a breath of fresh air in the climate of toxic news and its sad to see it lose its USP. .Best of luck",

        "I want to tell you something brother just listen and tell me is it correct or not.....#investmentplan.#reservationlaw.#parisolympics..I am 18+ studying College pursuing engineering in tier 3 college....There is a normal surprise checking in the hostel. eveytime.One day all faculty came to check unnecessary things in hostels like iron , kettle ,or any electrical things.. Desktop or monitor..while checking this they found condoms in my luggage bag I never used it. But I kept it after watching a video on YouTube about safe sex. I thought if something happens in my life I will have it safely...But on that checking day they found condoms in my luggage and without any argument they suspended me .. I told them it is not an illegal weapon. Just listen . They didn't listen to anything and on that day itself they suspended me.. for 1 month .. I told them to give me guidance if I am wrong instead of punishment. But they didn't listen. .Please tell me something about it brother please only u can tell me please please please   all the faculties whom I was connected with they seeing me like I have done something wrong. They think I have the wrong eye for them.. but I know I will never be able  to prove myself to them .. those teachers  were very friendly with me.. they were supporting me in everything because I was good in studies but after this news they are behaving like strangers.. their words are like I didn't expect this from you.. it hurts .. is keeping condoms in my personal luggage bag is soo much big issue?? Please don't take out my name bro.  Otherwise the whole internet will take it in another direction  please guide me I see you as my brother figure I am the only child of my family..

        "I am 3 times national level medalist ( 1 gold in SGFI National level ) in silambam ( Indian martial arts) after covid whole silambam association in dead no more nationals are happening and it is very ancient sports of india and believe me it is not easy to play just watch videos on it on yt. After winning national level gold my scholarship amt of 21k came to me after 1.5 years of waiting. And forgot abt state level championships all of the players have to sleep on the floor 50 guys in a room and the food we got lets just not go there, we have to drink tap water for straight 5 day. Every athlete in this country has to go through infinite struggle there are soo many problems regarding sports in this country if i started talking abt that it will take hours, as of now i have stopped playing after covid as i also have to support financially, and now all the sports i play is cricket, football and badminton in turf….esa lgra hai kitna boldu but it’s never going to get over, so next time you see any sports players ( if they have represented your state or nation in any sports) try to respect them they have to go through a lot to reach there.. also i am straight 7 times state level gold medalist for the straight 7 years but got to play only 3 nationals and thats a whole different story,…….. peace",

        "#InvestmentPlan ..One thing I've learned in the last three years of working is that our approach to investments often isn't the best. You can't build wealth with a ₹500 SIP. Instead, invest that ₹500 in yourself through courses or books that suit you. Once you start making good money, you'll be able to invest more significantly and see better returns. Nobody got rich with a ₹500 SIP...People are willing to spend 10-20 lakhs on formal education but hesitate to invest ₹5000 in a course that can bring opportunities worth lakhs. How ironic! Investing in yourself is the best way forward, especially early in your career...Coming to the 100 ruppes, vaise toh Sarthak bhaiya free mey recharge de rahe hai but with that 100, I'll access the internet.

        "#sundaysoch #ambani_wedding #inside_gossips #part2.Aish/ Jaya never interacted with each other at all. She was seated separately, Abhishek was seated next to Aish but they hardly had any conversation.\r.\r.Most Shetty family members was very sweet to all the staff and employs. They seem like a close bonded family and socialize to a minimum only Suniel Shetty’s wife is arrogant and expects staff to treat her with “extra” respect.\r.\r.Jaya Bachan, Shweta Nanda and Navya need to learn to behave better in public. They were constantly making weird face expressions. A team member helped Shweta to the washroom and she kept telling the style team member how she think she’s the best dressed for the event.\r.\r.Kriti's argument with Jaya ji was over Kirti chatting with Sr. Ab and praising him for his role in Kalki, Jaya is the most insecure person. And Kriti after being drunk at Baraat she was tipsy and being overly friendly.\r.\r.5**. SRK- Gauri** entered really late by then Priyanka had finished dancing in the barat and was in the main hall. They did not cross paths.\r.\r.6. Deepika and Katrina were standing next to each other after the shaadi was over but other then the usual pleasantries they never spoke to each other.\r.\r.7. Katrina seemed bored all through the event and she was being rude to everyone, the staff including Vicky. She keeps giving Vicky weird stares. Katrina and Vicky attended the second day event but was wearing something different than what she posted on her Instagram. It was supposed to hide her baby bump. Nor did they pose for Paps on the second day.\r.\r.8. Salman was around Anant the whole time like he was his best friend and at one point even Salman was getting annoyed because Anant kept pulling him everywhere.\r.\r.9. The jewellery on the Ambani’s; it’s true they may own the most expensive jewellery in the world but for convenience sake they had the same designs made in lighter metals because the functions were long and it would have been uncomfortable.\r.\r.10. Karan Johar was sidelined all through the events. Even SRK and Gauri who are like family to him did not give him much attention. Even the nepos kept their distance. Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",

        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male.

        "#ParisOlympics ..Sarthak bhaiya i totally aggre on the point that gender should be out of the sport.biological male should compete with biological male and biological female should compete with biological female.But here the case is wrong,she is born as female , the only problem that she have is that she has more male hormones than that estrogen. But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man. I have no hatered for any people and for not for LGBTQ community but I think such comments and remarks will only make the athlete mentally unstable for next matches...Sarthak bhaiya i just suggest you please mention this topic in next video..Other than this your video was very informative ..Thank you!!",

Something about Karan did not seem fine.\r.\r.11. Natasha Poonawala I think mistook the theme as met gala, she even wanted solo photos on red carpet though her family was there.\r.\r.12. Veer and Shikhar were super annoying, they just wanted to be anywhere and everywhere the cameras were. Veer and Manushi relationship seems very PR driven. They hardly interacted.\r.\r.13. The wedding was according to Hindu traditions and in typical Gujarati weddings no alcohol is allowed at the wedding. But everyone was drunk before the actual wedding started.\r.\r.14. Raddhika is not as nice as she seems; she’s all smiles and humble while the cameras are rolling otherwise she throws a tantrum over the smallest thing. She’s nita Ben junior. Raddhika lost her cool on a mua for suggesting another eye makeup look.\r.\r.15. Shloka is the very naive one, everyone seems to ignore her. She is also the sweetest she always asked everyone on the wedding planning team if they have eaten, she doesn’t seem to do only do things for the camera. She actually has a motherly instinct. Unlike Isha who only holds her children if she’s being filmed. Shloka and Akash share a weird equation. He seems very toxic towards her and she agrees to anything she’s told to do.\r.\r.16. Suhana is like a doll too good to be true. She seems to do everything Gauri or Shweta tell her to do. She has no personality of her own.\r.\r.17. Nepos had the moment of their entire existence after seeking Kim kardashian. And they kept gossiping about Kim and Khloes look . They were just happy to be in the presence of their idol. A statement from one nepo “I cannot believe this, she’s here, like really she’s with us, Kim is the OG”.\r.\r.18. Nita Ambani is fake as hell. She loses her cool if her assistants even touch her by mistake. She considers anyone lesser than her as untouchables. Nita was utterly rude to Shloka for looking tired, for heaven sake she’s a mother to two young kids.\r.\r.19. Mukesh Ambani is a smart business man but he literally dances on his wife’s tunes. He happily does all those cringe videos just to make her happy. Otherwise Nita Ambani throws a lot of tantrums.\r.\r.20. Isha Ambani and her husband aren’t together. It’s only photo OPs. He seems done with the Ambani circus even his family preferred to stay away from the main circus.\r.\r.21. All the photo shoots of the Ambani’s were pre done before the wedding started and were uploaded just before the function with that respective outfit was put out. That’s why in some pictures after the wedding Raddhika can be seen without mehendi.\r.\r.22. Raddhika family was sidelined all through the wedding except for the day paps were invited but Raddhika herself seems to not want to interact much with them. Raddhika’s sister is actually very pretty. But she was treated very badly by the Ambani’s.\r.\r.23. FLOBW were present. Maheep and Bhavana on day 1 and Bhavana with Chunky on day 2\r.\r.24. Major business family representatives were not papped and they have very different seating areas.\r.\r.25. Political party leaders from the ruling party and opposition were present some of them were not papped.\r.\r.26. The Ambani’s may have had 1000 chefs from all over the world but the food was really not authentic to the taste they tired to add an Indian touch to even Mexican and Italian dishes. Even the pastries were mediocre. They could have found better caters at much better prices.\r.\r.27. No international singers like Drake Adele or Lana Del Ray performed at the functions. It was all fake news. But the Indian singers out did themselves the performances were soulful and much better than any international artist.\r.\r.28. Ananya really was enjoying her single status, she seemed to be hanging onto anyone who was even remotely showing any interest in her. Ananya is way prettier than the other nepo kids and can carry off the worst outfits well. Though she seems to pretend or is actually dumb.\r.\r.29. DDC is dudh seh dulhe hua chokre. PPC was Raddhika bridesmaids. But couldn’t get the meaning of it. Someone said powerful puff chokriya.\r.\r.30. Nepos like Shanaya, Ananya, khushi were Anant’s brigade.\r.\r.31. South stars were very decent and most of them seem down to earth. They attended the wedding, no extra nautanki and left.\r.\r.32. South stars except Rajni are treated differently. Like the lesser version of Bollywood, though there are way more successful. Rajnikanth even danced in the barat for some time and then went into the wedding hall and sat down with his family.\r.\r.33. About the 2cr watches, all the grooms friends got it. But A- listers like Shahrukh and Salman got another watch as well which was almost doubt the cost of these watches.\r.\r.34. Alia is very clingy and she will follow Ranbir everywhere. It’s cute to an extent but it seems like even Ranbir is bored of the constant stalking.\r.\r.35. After the barat most of the ones dancing were in no state to actually attend the actual wedding.\r.\r.36. Cannot confirm this , but quite a few stars were paid to attend the functions. May not be in the form of money but movie deals, endorsements or sponsorships, etc.\r.\r.37. Every younger generation actor was too busy staring at Kim and the older ones were so tempted.\r.\r.39. When PM Modi entered, Kim did not know how to react and she thought he was some priest come to congratulate the bride.\r.\r.40 There were private areas for special guests so that no one could pap or intrude into some VIP areas.\r.\r.41 A  lot of the younger celebrities talking about the comments they were getting on their looks on Reddit\r.\r.Reminder - You can dissect each point, don't abuse Source\r.\r.Media - Give credit if you copy please.bhai recharge krde pls",
        "#SundayViichaar.Indian Education system is on ventilator now and students are in heaven........ No one is taking Everyone busy in Hindu Muslim, casteism etc.... .@sarthak What is your opinion on current education system???",
        "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree."

        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",

        "#KanwarYatra\r.Our family's running tradition is to go on Kanwar Yatra after clearing Boards. It has been two years since I passed out from school and it still remains a dream. I really wanted to go but I might reconsider it after the news of Kanwar Yatri's outrage and violence. It is quite disheartening to see such a beautiful tradition in a bad light. As a Hindu, it becomes my responsibility to recover the damage. Ek jagah Hindus and Muslims are going on Kanwar Yatra unified and on the other hand, we get news of violence and vandalisation from these yatris who are symbols of devotion and Hinduism.",
        "22:04 #KanwarYatra its seems to be a big problem.. many reasons like   Huge involvement of unsocial elements , destroying someone’s property which he earned throughout his/her life span and to glorify it our ruling party made a rule of displaying name of vendors !! Personally the worst decision from bjp this time they made me feel regretted to vote ..If these things continue the real devotees will suffer and it might led to the closure of this Yatra if we look to a broader side",
        "I am 3 times national level medalist ( 1 gold in SGFI National level ) in silambam ( Indian martial arts) after covid whole silambam association in dead no more nationals are happening and it is very ancient sports of india and believe me it is not easy to play just watch videos on it on yt. After winning national level gold my scholarship amt of 21k came to me after 1.5 years of waiting. And forgot abt state level championships all of the players have to sleep on the floor 50 guys in a room and the food we got lets just not go there, we have to drink tap water for straight 5 day. Every athlete in this country has to go through infinite struggle there are soo many problems regarding sports in this country if i started talking abt that it will take hours, as of now i have stopped playing after covid as i also have to support financially, and now all the sports i play is cricket, football and badminton in turf….esa lgra hai kitna boldu but it’s never going to get over, so next time you see any sports players ( if they have represented your state or nation in any sports) try to respect them they have to go through a lot to reach there.. also i am straight 7 times state level gold medalist for the straight 7 years but got to play only 3 nationals and thats a whole different story,…….. peace",

        "#SundayVichar Namskar Aadam and Welcome to the 5 months recharge plan.1. Olympics controversy:- I think male and females should have their area to play. Just because someone feels like something else doesn't mean he or she should get advantage. And If their medical report says otherwise then the Olympic Committee should Introduce one more category just like differently able personnel. .2. Big boss, Big boss, Big Boss chodo yaar main dhakta he nahi, So not interested .3. Digital news ott broadcast:- Yes, there should be a law for OTT and Social Media News, But gov should consult all parties and take their advice and most importantly use their advice. One piece of advice from my side for just YT news channels is that, rules should be divided into two parts first 1. For all creators and 2. Creator with High income or high viewer ship per annum. And punishments like Channel ban and video deleting should not be done before the court's final verdict..4. Caste Census:- I completely agree with you, it's just that a political leader should misuse this data just to get Vote and promote Caste divide. Verna to Hindu Muslim baad main phala Caste par divide hoga..4. UPSC:- Yes, it is very sad for the loss of Students. I don't think UPSC institutions are wrong as Vikas Sir said in his interview after this, there are no rules about coaching as they are not considered as educational institutions in GST fillings and DDA, MCD and fire department should be held for liable. Car vala ki ti galti thi he nahi ussa to faltu main fasa diya.. just galat time pai galat jigha tha vo... .5. Climate change is real we should ask our leaders hard questions( Sorry hamko to Caste par ladna hai ) .6. Caste classification:- It is a big step and the state government should use it fairly beyond their voter base. Btw this sould have been done by Parliament .7. 3 lack :- This Show how Aamir Aamir ho raha hai gareeb gareeb ho raha hai... Vesa Bhuva na le tu 1% main hu mai ve flex .8. Investment:- I think a lot of people don't have knowledge about how to invest.. merko khud nahi hai or dar or lagta hai yaar vo aalag.. just like Court normal people ko samaj main he nahi aata Inka judgment.... .8. Kavad yatra:- It's a blessing for all of us. Now, Role of police... bhai tum kuch karta q nahi ho... They have fear from the people above bas ab reason mat puchna Varna 5.9. Aasi Gf merko ve chaiya  .10. Bhai main kar lu ga intercaste bas ladki (Dost ban kar bathi hai yaar kab tak sahn karu 5 saal hona vala hai lagta hai Friend zone ho gaya hu ) and uske ghar vala + mera ghar vala man jaiya ..11.

        "As a Youtuber with such massive following, you should have done more research before making statements that imply that both boxers are male. And a cursory research would have debunked this lie. The determination of someone's sex is a far more complex issue than you make it to be. And while in anomalous cases, women could have XY chromosomes too, this is not even true in Imane Khelif's case. The claim came from the International Boxing Association, a highly corrupt body, with which the IOA had cut ties. This claim has not been established as yet. Khelif was assigned female at birth. ..Poland's Ewa Klobukowska set records and was a star athlete. She was among the first people to have been subjected to chromosomal tests owing to her masculine appearance. She was stripped of her medals and branded an impostor posing as a female for having XY chromosomes. Many years later, she had a son. Thirty odd years later, the IOC returned her medals, but the damage was done. ..Think about these athletes who train for their entire lives to compete at such elite levels, only to be accused of cheating without any basis. Think of the hordes of celebrities making false claims without any preliminary research, and the kind of impact it can have on these athletes. These accusations are mostly rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes and are almost always made against women of colour. Our own Dutee Chand has been subjected to discrimination owing to elevated testosterone levels. ..We forget that the Olympics is a competition of the best of human ability. If having higher testosterone gives females an advantage, why is Michael Phelps allowed to compete? He is the single most decorated Olympian of all time, and most discussions about him are incomplete without mention of how uniquely different his body is from any other human being. His higher than usual wingspan gives him great advantage over other competitors, but no one ever sees that as any reason to bar him.",
        "19:00  Hailing from one of the developing cities of East I had the opportunity in Lockdown to explore investment, I was financially stable by my part time teaching & my college fees were covered under scholarship, unlike my friends & peers where i witnessed lack of interest towards investment & future financial planning I thought it might be under the influence of society that we lived in but now that I have explored half of Northern States & connected with people's of diverse backgrounds I realise how important is to integrate financial literacy in curriculum. ..#InvestmentPlan start toh karo investment; people are scared to the core to even think of investment apart from Buying assets, currently in Capital City but there is little to no curiosity in exploring investment tools maybe due to hectic corporate life or something else that I have still to experience...#Backbenchers well i was neither a proper backbenchers nor the topper somewhere in between I did to some extent everything of both came top in few subjects scored lowest in some but it was a journey today when i visit schools of Delhi for surveys I wonder where we went wrong in the process of adopting Digital Inclusivity we lost the very essence of friends, senior junior interaction or be it school teachers being in touch outside school & curriculum.

        "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out. And Love Your Content Sarthak Ji",

        "#SundayVichar Sarthak bhai I have been following your content for more than a year now and was a big fan of your videos and your way of presentation. But for a quite long, your videos became too political that the fun element of the videos was just lost. Maybe this was due to the fact that the atmosphere of our nation has become such that we can't talk for a minute without presenting our political ideologies. But after watching this video, I have felt that the old style and aura of your videos have returned, that is too fun to watch along with unbiased information. This video has subtly mentioned a lot of issues and news that are relevant for us and was to the point. Glad to have the same The Sunday Show back!!..And talking about the various issues, I feel like almost all of them must be discussed today, but after being informative, unbiased and rational, for which I am learning more about those issues in detail. Nothing much to say, just felt like expressing this to you & your team.",

Ha abhi bhi India ke gao me jat -pat me mante he pr sehro me to bo bilkul khatam ho chuka he unke sath to koi discrimination nhi hota to bha se to khatam ho sakti he.. Mere kuch point he is pr - .  .1. Pehla to yehi ki rsevation unhe deni chahiye jinhe jarurat. Mere bahute se yese dost he jinke mami papa sarakari nokri me he or bo sc st catagory ke hone ke karan har chiz me easily select ho jate he. Instead mere papa yek farmer he or me general catagory  ka hu mere pass utne resources  nhi he fir bhi mujhe unke comparision me bhute jada mehnat karni padhti he.  Kisi bhi  exam ka cutoff sc st ke liye general se adha hota he. ..2. Me abhi collage me bsc kr rha hu. Mere  yek sal ki fees 10,000 he. Or  jo sc st bale unki 4000.. Jabki me to 10,000 bhi afford nhi kar sakta bhute muskil se aford kr pa rha hu . .Jinki 4000 he bo easly afford kr sakte he . 10000 se jada to bo mahine ka yese hi udha dete he  but fir bhi reservation  lete he ...3. Or sath me mujhe koi exam form bharne ho  .To meri fees lagti he or unki koi fees nhi lagti ..Yek exam form ki fees meri lagbhag 1000-1500  lagti he or unhe bahi exam free. Me de sakte he..4. Or me abhi ssc gd ki tayri kr rha tha fir form bharne ke time mujhe pata chla ki general ke bacho ke liye  hieght  170 cm honi chahiye  bahi   sc st balo ke liye 152 ya 154 cm chal padhegi . My hieght is 163 cm . Me us din bahute roya.  . . Koi govt. Se support nhi milta jitne resorces he  usme apna 100% deta hu fir bhi selection nhi hota kisi chiz me to dukh hota he or apne hi dost jiske mujhse adhe se bhi kam number aye he  jo yek achi finacial condition se ata he or uska selction ho jata he to kahi na kahi bura to lagta he bhute jada. . Me himachal se yek gao se hu or mujhe pata he ki sc st balo ko reservation  ki jarurat he lakin sabhi ko nhi  hamara gao me top govt. Job bale log sc st bale hi he or kuch sc st bale jinko genualy jarurat he bo iska fayda he ni uthate. Or ham jese general catagury ke boys jinko genualy jarurat he kosis bhi karate he unke liye sarkar kuch nhi  karti .  ..At last srthak bhi lots of love and respect to you ..PLESE MAKE A FULL VIDEO ON THIS INTERVIEWING PEOPLE . .LOVE YOU",

But she is pure female not like she was born as male and change gender.We have same case that in India of athlete Dutee Chand ,who also have same problem who have more testosterone in her body so she look like male but we all know she is female.And to compete in this Olympics she had also lower her testosterone level as per standard in 66 kg boxing...And some people will say she has advantage and she will always win which is unfair so for that people's I only want to say watch Olympics 2020 semi final where she was defeated by kelie Harrington, that time no people call  how can woman defeat man.

Michael Phelps has a bigger wingspan than the average male and Michael Jordan is taller than an avg person so they shouldn't be playing because they have an unfair advantage. That doesn't make sense. They were banned last time because of a single man and his corrupt ideology and he has been removed from the committee. Same thing happened to our Dutee Chand.

        "#SundayVichar #Reservation : Sarthak Reservation has always aimed at uplifting castes that have faced humiliation for thousands of years. It’s crucial to understand that the purpose of upliftment goes beyond merely meeting basic needs like food and clothing. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the marginalized would gain respect and self-esteem...In my view, the first generation benefiting from reservation often only meets their basic needs. The second generation achieves financial stability, and by the third generation, they reach a level of self-esteem that allows them to contribute to society and help others. Therefore, reservation benefits should be extended up to the third generation...The goal of reservation is to fulfill physical needs, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization for socially deprived communities. While I support the correction, it’s essential to consider the aim of reservation, especially since caste-based discrimination still exists. A large section of people still prioritizes a person's birth identity—something they didn't earn or choose—over the identity achieved through hard work. This is my viewpoint, and others may disagree."

        "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

If this thing happened this cuttoff will even go down. we should point out one thing even  there are people from sc/st who have become exceptionally rich(wealth). Still in IIT/IISc/IIMs/NLU are very few faculty less then 15% (reserved by law for sc) and 5%(reserved by law for sc). 0 generation student from sc/st they only study for survival. Therefore they target jobs like group c or group D. But 1st generation target jobs from group c or group a or group b. As jobs in group A(particularly iit faculty seats. Dept.

My question is if they are unable to find out talent withoutcreamy layer how can they find out with creamy layer) are not filled As per the law",
        "#Reservation I think the Creamy Layer (High Earning Class + Provided With Good Facilities Education) Reserved people are the ones those unknowingly discriminate the People those who actually are in need of reservation, they study in small cities with little to no resources and they score a certain percentile or score without any help and only on their ability, for them scoring those marks itself is an achievement cause the Structure of the Society isn't made to favor them to attain the same amount of marks and percentiles as the Creamy Layer of the Reserved Category people can because they have almost everything that they need to crack an exam, proper books, highly experienced teachers and expensive coaching. These Creamy Layer Candidates take the seats of the unprivileged people. Because they have better marks and percentiles than those unprivileged people because of obvious reasons. I think it's the morality that should come to the mind of a person taking a seat thinking that they are taking seat of a poor, less privileged person who worked hard for the seat but he missed the seat because his score was lower than another reserved candidate (who also had proper facilities and guidance), Reservation will be good if the actual needy people are getting the advantage, the literacy rate will grow. And Also, What's the need to use reservation if you have scored a good percentile. You are just Stepping Upon A Poor Marginalized Person's Hopes & Aspirations just to get a seat which you couldn't attain in the open category by using high class education facility, the recent news about the Tamil Student Who Got a Seat in NIT Trichy and Another in IIT Madras made me happy and it doesn't bothers anyone that reservation is used to provide education to those less privileged. I, a general candidate, am on a same boat as a Privileged Reserved Candidate who gets same facility as me same knowledge as me have no problem that they take my seat because it's purely merit based competition, but the problem is that they will take the seat of a unprivileged person is what brings concern. The Privileged should selflessly give up the reserved seat for the unprivileged ones. And I myself being general have many friends from other castes, but I hate to use the word lower and caste, we all are equal, yes they were discriminated and still are but the change happens from as Micheal Jackson Said Man In The Mirror, I eat food with them I laugh with them I play with them we share memories and it's all good, although some people are there who discriminate but world will not change in a day, disregarding those people is only we can do, Samaj me Badnami is the biggest fear of people, why can't we regard the practice of discrimination as a practice that would create samaj me badnami. In Some Privileged Reserved candidates I've seen a perspective that We Were Extremely Discriminated in the past by your forefathers and had to go from a hardship and hard time so we are going to take your seat by using reservation but instead they have to change their perspective and see that the general candidates are fighting for Unreserved seats and that too merit based, while taking up the reserved seats that too after being provided with good facilities you are just climbing upon the hopes of people and aspirants of your own communities because there are only limited reserved seats, So It's an appeal that if you think you aren't needy of reservation just let it go and pass it to someone else who is needy, then no laws would have to be made to segregate creamy and non-creamy layer, only thing that we need is the selfless act of letting go, No one will see your contribution but after 20 years when we will see the literacy rates go high discrimination being over ,those small contributions will create that big effect. Bringing Laws in a general manner may bring problems that even though being a person with good facility one can be discriminated in class so what would they do, laws won't favor them then, only act of selflessness towards the people being less privileged than you can bring change, which in my opinion isn't practically possible in this kalyug. So Laws are the thing that would actually help the larger extent of those non creamy people because sadly selflessness is not no common..My views and perspective may be wrong I am open for people to criticize or expand my perspective, Peace Out.

        "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

        "Hi Sarthak,..First and foremost, thank you for the amazing work you and your team do. Your content is so engaging that I wish it were a daily dive into the news instead of just weekly. Your show gives me the same excitement I felt as a child watching cartoons on Doordarshan, especially because it’s a great bonding activity for my family, despite being on different continents. Your informative yet palatable presentation of the news is much appreciated...Regarding the Imane Khelif situation, I respectfully disagree with your take. Here are my thoughts:..1. Her gender is debatable, as she allegedly has a disorder of sex development (DSD), commonly referred to as intersex. Her medical records should remain private due to the right to privacy..2. She was born in a conservative Islamic country where homosexuality and being intersex are illegal, likely limiting her options for addressing her condition..3. Imane is a dedicated and skilled boxer, competing at the world level is no small feat..4. There are no separate leagues for intersex athletes. Raised and identifying as a woman, she isn't physically equivalent to a man and it might not be fair to force her to compete with men..5. Should she give up her passion and talent because she doesn’t fit neatly into male or female categories? This isn’t her fault..6. She is facing global bullying and hate, which is brutal and undeserved. No one should endure such treatment..7. The debate around trans athletes is separate. Imane didn’t choose her condition, and it’s unfair to lump her situation with that of trans athletes..8. While rules and categories might need reevaluation, portraying Imane as a man dominating women is unfair. She has been defeated by other women in the past, and her victories should be celebrated...Thank you for considering my perspective...Best regards."

        "#ParisOlympics .Image Khalif allegedly has XY chromosomes and has been banned from the past competition but was allowed in the Olympics(check: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif). The same happened with Taiwan's Yu Ting both in boxing. The international boxing federation has done several controversial things so in my opinion they need to be more transparent about their criteria and even the scoring scheme. On the other hand when we talk about equality we need to make sure we have an inclusive and unbiased approach. I believe if there are enough people from transgender community then one solution could be to create a third category in the Olympics if not then they can have more sub classification for example instead of just different weight groups they can have different groups for different muscle mass and testosterone level. A committee of experts should evaluate and redefine the categories in which players fight. .Moreover, it's worth noting that Nigerian, Jamaican or African people clearly have an edge when it comes to Athletics but we don't ban them from participating. In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",

In fact it's worth noting that if you see Basketball teams most of the top players are black or/ and 6ft+ tall which is not the case for south Asian people but we don't ban them from participating so if it's about genetic advantage then it's not Imane's fault that they are made like this. They should also be allowed to participate but there should be strict classification on the basis of testosterone level, muscle mass and more aspects (such as clear genetic advantage) because it's possible to get Hormone therapy and tweak things a bit. .However, banning in the discriminatory fashion is not acceptable as it has previously happened to one Indian athlete due to her masculinity after which she never participated. Hence creating sub classification or third category with clear rules drafted by involving experts of respective sports, transgender community and common people or sports representatives of all the participating nations could be a better solution...P.S. It is worth noting that why only people with male characteristics tend to participate in female competition and not the other way round and why don't they compete from male category because then nobody will have any trouble if they do so? We all have an idea about the reasons behind it but I think there could be a deeper unethical (sub)conscious human beings thought of taking advantage of other people!.What do you think?",
        "I strongly oppose the Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2024. This bill is a blatant attempt to stifle freedom of expression and creativity in India. By requiring content creators to obtain licenses and follow strict rules, the government is essentially trying to control what we say and think. This is a clear attack on democracy and our fundamental rights.\r.\r.The fact that even international creators like Taylor Swift and Mr. Beast will be subject to content evaluation committees is absurd. It's a clear example of how this bill will not only harm Indian content creators but also make our country a laughing stock globally.\r.\r.We must stand against this bill and fight for our right to freely express ourselves. We cannot let the government turn us into puppets and dictate what we can and cannot say. The future of our democracy and creative freedom depends on it.",

        "I had seen a few of your videos but looking at the first comment made in the Olymic case showed how badly researched or opinionated the comment was. You may say that its your opinion but you have a significant following and are responsible to handle such issues delicately and without a bias. There is a reason why olympics committee has such detailed medical tests and regulations around them",
        "#ReservationLaw\r.\r.Hello Sarthak Bhaiya,\r.\r.I am 17 years old, living in a very small city (less than tier-2 cities), studying in class 12, and preparing for JEE Advanced 2025 to get admission into IITs and NITs. I belong to the OBC Creamy Layer because my father pays taxes for the nation.\r.\r.Here's my problem: I recently checked the cut-off for IITs. I fall into the general category, which means I need to achieve a rank under 3000 to secure a spot, which is extremely difficult, believe me. I have two friends who enjoy the same privileges as me. One belongs to the SC category and the other to the general category. Both their fathers earn as much as mine from businesses, but they don't pay taxes.\r.\r.My SC friend can easily get into any IIT and can even make a fake EWS certificate to avoid paying the full fees. Similarly, my general category friend also makes a fake EWS certificate to get into IITs easily without paying the full fees. Even if I manage to get into an IIT, I would have to pay the full fee and might not even get my favorite branch due to the high cut-off.\r.\r.In IITs, almost 65% of the seats are reserved, and I have to compete for the remaining 35%, where only a few manage to get in after studying from class 6 or 9. Despite being a good student with 90%+ in class 10 and 12 boards, I might not get in because of these flawed reservation laws.\r.\r.Can I ask the government why my father, who pays taxes, gets nothing in return for himself and his children? We receive no freebies, no reservation benefits, and we also pay indirect taxes. Yet, the government seems to favor those who do not pay taxes and make fake EWS certificates. While some people genuinely need these laws, many misuse them.\r.\r.I know my comment might not be read by many since only 2-3% of people pay taxes, and this isn't a significant vote bank for the government. In states like Jharkhand, the government largely runs on ST freebies and reservations.\r.\r.Thank you for listening to my thoughts on reservation laws. I know I might not get into IITs, but I deserve it more than any fake EWS certificate holders and reserved category students. Now, I am considering BITS Pilani, which admits students based on merit, not reservation laws.\r.\r.This is a significant problem in our country caused by the government. Even though India has an ST woman as president, they still want reservations. The Indian Supreme Court must address this issue, as not everyone needs reservations in today's times.\r.\r.Once again, thank you. Please help make this comment go viral, Sarthak Bhaiya. \r.\r.-One of the Bigest problem in India.- tax saving.- making fake certificate.- Not a deserving one gets into IITs.- IITs have many not derserving Students",

        "#ParisOlympics .Sarthak, with duely respecting everyone's opinions, I'd like to say something. A few weeks back, I came across this study where scientists and biologists explained the relation between sexes and chromosomes. .We clearly know there's a difference between gender and sex, gender being societal in nature..This study showed that there aren't just XX and XY combinations possible, but a lot more..There's just X, there are semi-developed ones too (I'm just saying what I had read, these aren't proved by me)..What the wrestler faced, was one of the cases mentioned. She is biologically female, but like you had mentioned, with XY dominated chromosomes..I meant, it's not her fault she has this; as a female, she's just playing in a female category...Categorizing sports on the basis of this doesn't seem fair, but I really wish there was a solution to this.",
